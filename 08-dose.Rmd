# Absorbed Dose {#dose}

To measure the absorbed dose from ionizing radiation within a medium, we need to know 

1. The number of particles or photons, or the quantity of energy, passing through the medium (_fluence_)
2. The quantity of energy transferred from initial particles (often photons, which are uncharged) to charged particles in the medium (_KERMA_)
3. The rate at which energy is transferred from the charged particles in the medium, to the medium itself (stopping power, leading to absorbed dose).

$\color{Green}{Fluence}$ is defined as the number of particles $dN$ incident on a sphere of cross-sectional area $da$. The SI unit is $m^{-2}$

\begin{equation}
    \Phi = \frac{dN}{da}
    (\#eq:fluence)
\end{equation}

$\color{Green}{Energy\ fluence}$ ($\Psi$, unit: $J\cdot m^{-2}$) is defined as the energy dE incident on a sphere of cross-sectional area da. The SI unit is $J\cdot m^{-2}$. 

\begin{equation}
    \Psi = \frac{dE}{da}
    (\#eq:efluence)
\end{equation}

If you have a fluence $\Phi$ of particles all of energy E, then the energy fluence is simply $\Psi = \Phi\cdot E$.

$\color{Green}{KERMA}$ (Kinetic Energy Released per unit MAss) is defined as the mean kinetic energy transferred to charged particles from uncharged particles in a mass dm of a given material. The SI unit is J/kg, and the special name for the unit for Kerma is gray (Gy).

\begin{equation}
    K=\frac{d\bar E_{tr}}{dm} ~ (J\cdot kg^{-1}\ or\ Gy)
    (\#eq:kerma)
\end{equation}

The relation between Kerma and fluence can be expressed as
$$K=\int \Psi(E)\frac{\mu_{tr}(E)}{\rho}dE$$
Where $\frac{\mu_{tr}(E)}{\rho}$  is the mass energy transfer coefficient of the material for uncharged particles of energy E. 

$\color{Green}{Unrestricted\ stopping\ power}$ for charged particles (electrons) is defined as 
$$ S = \frac{dE}{dx} $$

* Collisional stopping power ($S_{coll}$)
* Radiative stopping power ($S_{rad}$) – cause by the interactions of charged particles with nuclear electric field – bremsstrahlung radiation
The relationship of fluence and stopping power to absorbed dose is given by: 

$$D_{med}=\int \Phi_{med, E}(E)\frac{S_{coll}(E)}{\rho}dE$$


## Optical density

The details about the radiographic films can be found in AAPM [TG-69](https://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_216.pdf): Radiographic film for megavoltage beam dosimetry. 

## Q9 OD

A pivotal assumption in film dosimetry is that the dose to the film is reflected in the resulting “blackness” or optical density (OD) of that film.  
$$OD=log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{T}\right)=log_{10}\left( \frac{I_0}{I_t}\right)$$

The details about radiochromic films  can be found in AAPM [TG-55](http://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/RPT_216.pdf) and its update AAPM [TG-235](http://www.aapm.org/org/structure/default.asp?committee_code=TG235) as well an excellent review article by [Butson et al. "Radiochromic film for medical radiation dosimetry” (2003)](http://hepweb03.phys.sinica.edu.tw/opto/Irradiation/RadioChromic/Documents/MSE41_61.pdf). Table 1 lists the radiation interaction processes and their variation with Z.
