# Radiation Protection {#protection}

Historically, the most commonly used unit in US is millirem (mrem) where rem stands for <font color="Salmon">Roentgen Equivalent Man</font>. The SI unit of effective dose and equivalent dose is <font color="Salmon">Sievert</font> (Sv). Because 1 Sv, equal to 1 Gy numerically, is rather large quantity, the milliSievert (mSv) is commonly used in practice. The relationship between mSv and mrem is, 

<b>1 mSv = 100 mrem</b>.


## Regulatory agencies

- U.S. NRC
    * Naturally occurring radioisotopes
    * Reactor- and accelerator-produced radionuclides
    * Documentation (RT-related): 10 CFR 35, Part 19, 20, and 35
- States 
    * X-ray – generating machines (CT simulator and Linac)
    * NRC regulated materials (agreement states[^agreed]) 
- FDA
    * Manufacture and sale of machines and TPS’s (501K clearance) 
- DOT
    * Safe transport of radioactive materials

[^agreed]:
If the licensees can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States.

## Sources of radiation exposure

According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) report 160 (2009), the average annual radiation dose per person in the U.S. is about 6.2 mSv, in which medical imaging contributes about 50% (e.g. CT: 24%, NM: 12%, interventional fluoroscopy 7%, conventional radiography 5%). Naturally occurring sources of radiation include cosmic radiation (5%), radioactive minerals in the ground and in your body (5%), and terrestrial radiation emitted by naturally occurring materials such as uranium, thorium, and radon (37%) in earth. The pie chart of sources of radiation exposure from NCRP 160 can be found [here](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-sources-and-doses_.html).


## Stochastic and deterministic event

Although the severity of the stochastic effect is independent of the dose, the probability of having such effects is proportional to the dose **without dose threshold**. The examples of stochastic effects include radiation induced cancer and genetic mutation. Skin erythema, epilation (hair loss), lens opacification, and tissue necrosis are best described as non-stochastic or **deterministic** events. For deterministic effects, there is a threshold and the severity of the effect depends on the dose.

To avoid unacceptable complications, normal tissue should be below a **tolerance dose** (TD) (Emami et al.) Complications is categorized as fatal, severe (e.g. grade 3-4 pneumonitis), and quality-of-life complications. TD5%/5 and TD50%/5 are used to imply complications in 5 years.


### TDS rule

Time ($D \propto \dot{D}\times \Delta t$), distance (inverse square law), and shield (attenuation) measures are major factors in consideration of minimizing the unavoidable radiation exposure. Other procedures to minimize the exposure are containment and NRC’s system for radiation protection according to NRC guidelines. The NRC’s system for protection includes (1) dose limits for radiation workers and members of the public; (2) monitoring and labeling radioactive materials; (3) posting signs in and around radiation areas; and (4) reporting the theft or loss of radioactive material. In addition, the NRC imposes penalties for failures to follow the agency's regulations.

If the licensees’ can limit the radiation to **1 mSv** to the public and **50 mSv** to adult radiation works in a
year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called **Agreement States**.

### ALARA


## Shielding Calculation

Shielding design goal, workload, use factor, occupancy factor. 

### Design goal

This design goal for an **uncontrolled** area is 0.02 mSv/week (about 1 mSv annually for frequent or continuous exposure) or for a **controlled** area is **0.1 mSv/week** (about 5 mSv annually – this is lower than the recommended value of 50 mSv but is based upon the ALARA principle). 

The <font color="Salmon">primary barrier</font> is designed and constructed to attenuation useful high energy and high dose rate beams. The most commonly used detector is a large-volume pressurized ionization chamber survey meter. Although a GM counter may be used to quickly detect shielding issue, it can't measure radiation of high dose rates due to the “dead time”  of the tub. In addition, the GM counter cannot distinguish the energy (e.g. 6 MV and 15 MV) of the incident radiation.[^detectors] 

[^detectors]:
A farmer-type ionization chamber is most commonly used for linac output measurements. It is not suitable for survey measurement due to its small detection volume, ~0.6cc. A scintillation detector is designed (a scintillator plus a photo-multiplier) to detect small signals. For example, a liquid scintillation counter is used to detect removable I-125 contamination on swabs. A BF3 proportional counter is most commonly used for neutron detection.

The **radiation safety committee** is required by the USNRC for institutions under a type-A specific license of broad scope ([10. CFR part 33.11](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part033/part033-0011.html)) as a means for managerial control over licensed activities. The committee shall consist of a radiation safety officer (RSO), an authorized user, a representative of management who is neither the RSO nor an authorized user, and a nurse. There are also Type B and C specific license of broad scope for licensees in using one and/or two isotopes and limited quantities.

## Survey

A radiation survey is required after linacs are installed in the vault. Typically, a Geiger-Müller (GM) counter, a large-volume pressurized ion chamber, and a BF~3~ proportional counter (if high energy photons are installed) are used to perform this task. 

### Detectors

A GM counter is used to detect the **presence** of radiation, which consists of a tube filled with lower pressure (~ 0.1 atmosphere) inert gas (98% helium and 1.3% butane. For radiation survey, it is used to detect potentially unexpected large exposure due to deviation of construction from the planned schematic. In contrast to measuring average current produced over **many interactions** as in an ion chamber, the reading is recorded for each **individual** interaction in a GM detector. Therefore, a GM counter suffers its inability (due to "dead time"[^deadtime] of the tube) to measure high exposure rate from a linac even behind barriers. In addition, a GM counter cannot distinguish the energy (e.g. 6 MV and 15 MV) of the incident radiation. A GM counter 

[^deadtime]:

The “dead time” is the time it takes for the GM detector to “reset” (for the readout circuit). During this reset process, the GM counter does not “measure” any radiation.

A large volume pressurized ion chamber survey meter is used to quantify the exposure behind barriers.

A BF~3~ proportional counter is most commonly used for neutron detection. A BF~3~ counter is an active monitoring (passive monitoring: bubble detectors, TLDs) device that uses Boron to capture neutrons.
