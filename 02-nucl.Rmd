# Nuclear Transformation {#nut}

> Radioactivity was discoverred in 1986 by A.H. Becquerel when he wa 44 years old ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Becquerel)). He received 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Maria and Pierre Curie.

## Nuclear Decay (disintegration) {#decays}

General balance equations of radioactive decay

\begin{equation}
 _Z^A P = ^{A-A_R}_{Z-Z_R}D + _{Z_R}^{A_R}R + \sum Q, 
\end{equation}

where P and D stand for parent and daughter element, R for radiation, and Q is reaction energy ($\sum Q = M_P-M_D-M_R$). To find out the Q-value, you can use a online [Q-calculator](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/qcalc/).

Atoms found in nature are either stable or unstable. An atom is unstable (radioactive) if these forces are unbalanced if the nucleus has an excess of internal energy [EPA link](http://www.epa.gov/radiation/understand/radiation.html). The instability of a radionuclide  may result from an excess of either neutrons or protons. Radionuclides attempt to reach stability through

1. ejecting neutrons and protons (Alpha-decay);
2. converting one to the other with ejection of a beta particle or positron (Beta decay);
3. the release of additional energy by photon emission (Gamma decay). 

### Alpha-decay {#alpha}

Alpha-decay occurs in nuclides with atomic numbers above 82 (only the first 92 occur naturally) and where the ratio of neutrons to protons is low, thus resulting in the repulsive coulomb force of the protons overcoming the attractive strong nuclear force.

$$
\begin{matrix}
\underline{\text{Example}} & _{88}^{226}Ra\rightarrow _{86}^{222}Rn +_2^4\alpha +\gamma +Q
\end{matrix}
$$

### Beta-decay {#beta}

Beta-decay, a neutron within the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron and an antineutrino are emitted, or a proton is converted into a neutron, and a positron and a neutrino are emitted. The forces responsible for the $\beta$-decay are weak (referred to as _weak nuclear force_) compared with both the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force among the nucleons.

$$
\begin{matrix}
\underline{\text{Example}} & \begin{matrix}
    \beta^-\  \text{decay}& _{60}^{27}Co\rightarrow _{27}^{60}Ni^{*} +\beta^- + \bar\nu \\ 
    \beta^+\  \text{decay} & _{9}^{18}F\rightarrow _{8}^{18}O +\beta^+ +\nu + 1.022\ \text{MeV}
  \end{matrix}
\end{matrix}
$$
*Neutrino* ($\nu$) and *anti-neutrino* ($\bar \nu$) results in spectrum of $\beta$ energies, and they are non-ionizing particles so we don't consider them in dose calculation. The average energy of beta particles is about **1/3** of the maximum possible energy of $\beta$ particles (the same maximum possible energy of neutrinos).

### Electron capture {#ec}

Electron capture (EC) is an alternative to positron decay. In this process, an electron, usually in the K shell, is captured within the nucleus and combined with a proton to create a neutron. Electron capture most often is followed by characteristic x-ray or Auger electron.

### Gamma decay {#gamma}

Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy level. These $\gamma$-rays are identical to the x-rays emitted by excited atoms, except that $\gamma$-rays originate from within the nucleus and x-rays originate from outside the nucleus. The example is that Co-60 decays to Ni^*-60 by emitting two $\gamma$-rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV.The decay scheme can be found [here](http://atom.kaeri.re.kr:8080/gamrays.html).

## Activity {#activity}

The <font color="Salmon">activity</font> (A) of a sample is the average number of disintegrations (decay) per second,

\begin{equation}
    A = \frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = \lambda N,
    (\#eq:activity-decayconstant)
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is the The <font color="Salmon">decay constant</font> which is the probability that a nucleus will decay per second. Remember that Radioactive decay is a **stochastic** process. We can find certain laws only by observing a large number of events (decays here).

From the equation above, we can obtain the radioative decay law at a certain time $t$:

\begin{equation}
    N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t},
    (\#eq:decay-N)
\end{equation}

or 
\begin{equation}
    A = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}. 
    (\#eq:decay-A)
\end{equation}

The SI unit for radioactivity is Becquerel (Bq). The historic unit for radioactivity is Curie (Ci), and 1g of radium is 1 Ci. The relationship between Curie and Becquerrel is  

<div align="center">
  <b>1 Ci = 3.7 GBq</b>
</div>

More frequently, we use <font color="Salmon">physical half-life</font> or just <font color="Salmon">half-life</font> ($T_{1/2}$) instead of the decay constant $\lambda$. Their reqlationship is  

\begin{equation}
    T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}.
    (\#eq:half-life)
\end{equation}

The <font color="Salmon">average life</font> is the (arithmetic) average lifetime for the decay of radioactive atomes. It relates to half-life by 
\begin{equation}
    T_{ave} \equiv \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.44T_{1/2}.
    (\#eq:ave-life)
\end{equation}
The remaining activity after a time interval equal to the average life is **37%** ($A = A_0 e^{-\lambda T_{ave}}$. The average or mean life is used to calculated the total decays. For example, the total number of decays of 1 mCi Cs-137 is about $5.0\times 10^{16}$ ($= T_{ave}\times{A} = 1.44\times(30\ y)\times(3.15\times 10^{7}\ s/y)\times(3.7\times 10^{7}\ decay/s)$).

```{block, type='FOO'}
For a Co-60 source, what is the activity in GBq of a sample containing 10^16^ atoms? What is the specific activity (SA) of the sample in GBq/g?
```
Using Eq. \@ref(eq:activity-decayconstant) or \@ref(eq:half-life)

\begin{aligned}
A &= \lambda N \\
    &= \frac{ln2}{T_{1/2}} N \\
    &= \frac{0.693}{(5.3\ yr) \times (365 \times 86,400\ s/yr)} \times 10^{16} atoms \\
    &= 4.1 \times 10^7 atoms/s \\
    &= 0.041\text{ GBq}
\end{aligned}

The sample mass can be calculated by

\begin{aligned}
mass &= \frac{(10^{16}\ atoms) \times (59.9338\ g/...)}{6.023\times 10^{23}atoms/...} \\
    &= 9.95\times 10^{-7}\text{ g}
\end{aligned}

where ... is called gram-atomic mass. 

<hr>

The <font color="Salmon">special acitivity</font> (= activity/mass) is thus about 0.041 GBq/g. Based on this calculation, it can be seen that special activity is **inversely** proportional to half-life and mass number.

```{block, type='FOO'}
For a Cs-137 source, how long does it decay to 98% of the original activity?
```

Using Eq. \@ref(eq:decay-N) or \@ref(eq:decay-A) and \@ref(eq:half-life), we get

$$
A = A_0e^{-\frac{ln2}{30}t} \rightarrow 0.98 = e^{-\frac{ln2}{30}t} \rightarrow t =0.87\ \text{years}
$$

It is easy to solve the above equation, but it will be faster to find a good estimation using the `Taylorâ€™s expansion` with first two terms $e^{-\frac{ln2}{30}t} \approx  1-\frac{0.693}{30}t$. The caveat of using Taylor expansion is make sure the exponents are much smaller than 1. You can try this approach for question 3, but you will not get the correct answer. The yearly decay rate of Cs-137 is about 72/30 = 2.4% using **the Rule Of 72** (i.e., you can double your invest using 72/a year rate of return (ROR), kind of reversed). The monthly and daily decay rate for Co-60 and Ir-192 is about **1.13%** and **0.97%**.
