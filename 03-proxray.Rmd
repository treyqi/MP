# Production of X-rays {#prox}

## History

- Cathod-ray tube (for example, Crookes tube)^[partially vaccum and low voltage; think about neon lighting; see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_tube)]. 
- 1895-11-08, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-ray by observing fluorsece when applying high volotage (using an induction coil) on a board-covered Crookes tube ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Röntgen) and [The Laureates: William Roentgen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVn3mgt8Two).
- Coolidge developed the __hot cathode__ x-ray tube in 1913, in which a wire filament was heated with electrical current to release electrons by the process of `thermionic emission`. This was the first major breakthrough as cathod-ray tubes cannot generate reliable and high-intensity x-ray. 
- The next major breakthrough in x-ray tube design was the **rotating anode**, which was developed by Albert Bouwers in 1930.

## Conventional x-ray tubes

The basic components of a useful x-ray tube include: (a) electron source, (b) high voltage supply, (c) target for x-ray production, (d) vacuum, and (e) collimator. 

### Electron Source

- Tungsten (melting point is 3370 ^o^C).
- The filament is housed within a negatively charged focusing cup.
- With high voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are attracted to the target (anode) without electrons pile-up around the filement. In this scenerio, the tube is operated in the mode of `filament-emission limited`. 
- With lower voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are not pulled immediately to the target. The accumulated electrons (_space charge_) will prevent additional electrons leaving the filament and therefor limit the tube current. Under this condition, the tube is operated in the mode of `space-charge limited` (e.g. mammography machine).
- Dual-focus x-ray tube

### High voltage

The electric potential difference (voltage) between the filament (cathode) and target (anode) of an x-ray tube affects the x-ray output, **intensity** (see electron source part) and spectrum of x-ray.
