# Treatment Planning I: Isodose Distribution and Plan Evaluation {#planning1}

## Penumbra
The dose distribution outside the field boundaries is significantly affected by geometric penumbra, depth, leakage radiation through collimator. The flattening filter mostly affect dose within the field boundary.

## Wedges

* Physical wedge
    + External physical wedge
    + Internal physical wedge (aka motorized wedge, as in Elekta^TM^ machines) typically consists of a single large wedge (e.g., 60 degrees) placed above the secondary collimating jaws. The smaller angle is form by combining the open (o) field and the 60$^o$ degree wedge field:
$$ Dose_{\theta}=W_{o}Dose_{o} + W_{60^o}Dose_{60^o},$$
where $W_{60^o}=\frac{tan\theta}{tan{60^o}}$. 

* Non-physical wedge 
    + _Virtual wedge_ (as in Siemens^TM^)
    + _Enhanced dynamic wedge_ (EDW) in Varian^TM^, which is implemented by moving one of the collimating jaws from one end of the field to the other. 
    
_Wedge (isodose) angle_ is defined as the angle between wedged isodose curve (see figure wedge isodose) and the normal to the central axis at a specific depth (e.g., 10 cm). What we typically measure is wedge profile.
