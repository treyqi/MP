# Treatment Planning I: Isodose Distribution and Plan Evaluation {#planning1}

## Penumbra 

The dose distribution outside the field boundaries is significantly affected by geometric penumbra, depth, leakage radiation through collimator. The flattening filter mostly affect dose within the field boundary.

The disucssion of penumbra can be found in Section \@ref(penumbra). 

## Wedges {#wedges}

- Physical wedge
    * External physical wedge
    * Internal physical wedge (a.k.a <font color="Salmon">motorized wedge</font>, as in Elekta^TM^ machines) typically consists of a single large wedge (e.g., 60 degrees) placed above the secondary collimating jaws. The wedge field is form by a combination of an open (o) field and a 60^o^ wedge field:
    
\begin{equation}
D_{\theta}=w_{O}D_{O} + w_{60^o}D_{60^o},
(\#eq:mwedge)
\end{equation}
$\quad\quad\quad\quad$ where the weight $w_{60^o}=\frac{tan\theta}{tan{60^o}}$. 

- Non-physical wedge 
    * <font color="Salmon">Virtual wedge</font> (as in Siemens^TM^)
    * <font color="Salmon">Enhanced dynamic wedge</font> (EDW) in Varian^TM^, which is implemented by moving one of the collimating jaws from one end of the field to the other. 
    
<font color="Salmon">Wedge (isodose) angle</font> is defined as the angle between wedged isodose curve (see figure wedge isodose) and the normal to the central axis at a specific depth (e.g., 10 cm). What we typically measure is wedge profile.

```

### Wedge factors {#wf}

According to Khan, the <font color="Salmon">wedge (transmission) factor</font> is defined as the ratios of dose measurement for a wedge field over that for an open field with the **same field size** and at the same depth along the central of the beam. It can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\text{WF}=\frac{\text{D}_W(FS,d)}{\text{D}_O(FS,d)}.
\end{equation}

The wedge factor required by the Pinnacle TPS is specifically defined as the ratio of the dose measurement for a wedge field and that for a open field (10 cm $\times$ 10 cm) at the same depth of 10 cm (this is ICRU specified depth): $$\text{WF}_{Pinnacle} = \frac{\text{D}_W(FS, 10\ cm)}{\text{D}_O(FS_c, 10\ cm)},$$ where the subscription c stands for calibration.[^latex] The sample 6 MV WF~pinnacle~ can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:wfx6) (form reference 3).

## Treatment techniques

- Single beam (posterior beam for spine treatment)
- Opposed beams 
- Multiple stationary fields
    - conformal
    - wedge
    - IMRT/sliding window
- Rotational beams
    - conformal
    - VMAT

### Integral dose

The integral dose is defined as the total energy imparted tot he patient and is given by the product of the mass of issue and the dos it receives. For photon external beam radiotherapy, the higher the energy, the lower the integral dose. For the same energy, different delivery techniques do not affect the integral dose much. If you want to spare certain organs, other organs will receive more doses as the integral dose is pretty much a constant. This is an important idea for you to remember  when evaluating an IMRT/VMAT planif you wnat to spare nearby normally issues. The integral dose is an interesting concept but is has not been correlated to treatment outcome.
    
## Plan evaluation

### Dose-volume histogram

The cumulative DVH is a plot of the volume (y-axis) of a structure receiving a certain dose (x-axis) **or higher**. You need to find the differential (binned) DVH first, and then calculated cDVH. For example, simplified with a 2D contour here, the count for each bin is list in the first column. The i^th^ value in the second columun is calculated by summing from the i^th^ number to the last number in the first column.

**Shortcomings of DVHs**

1. does not provide spatial information of the dose in the targets or OARs
2. accuracy is subject to the uncertainties in contouring, dose calculation, modeling. 
3. the dose to organ surface (e.g. bladder) is more important than to the volume.

Readers may find that the Point/Counterpoint article ["Evaluation of treatment plans using target and normal tissue DVHs is no longer appropriate"](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1118/1.4903902) and presentation ["Treatment plan evaluation"](https://www.sasro.ch/sites/default/files/sasro/SRO-continuos/TPSevaulation.pdf) are good read.
