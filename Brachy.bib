	abstract = {The major errors in {HDR} procedures were failures to enter the correct treatment distance, which could be caused by either entering wrong transmission lengths or imprecisely digitizing the dwelling positions. Most of those errors were not easily avoidable by enhancing the {HDR} management level because they were caused by implementations of nonstandardized applicators utilizing transmission tubes of different lengths in standard {HDR} procedures. We performed this comprehensive study to include all possible situations with different nonstandardized applicators that frequently occurred in {HDR} procedures, provide corresponding situations with standard applicator as comparisons, list all possible errors and in planning, clarify the confusions in offsets setting, and provide mathematical and quantitative solutions for each given scenarios. Training on {HDR} procedures with nonstandardized applicators are normally not included in most residential program for medical physics, thus this study could be meaningful in both clinical and educational purpose. At precision of 1 mm, our study could be used as the essential and practical reference for ﬁnding the correct treatment length as well as locating the accurate dwelling positions in any {HDR} procedure with nonstandardized applicators.},

The International Organization for Standardization ({ISO}) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement ({GUM}) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) Technical Note 1297 are taken as reference standards for uncertainty formalism. Uncertainties in using detectors to measure or utilizing Monte Carlo methods to estimate brachytherapy dose distributions are provided with discussion of the components intrinsic to the overall dosimetric assessment. Uncertainties provided are based on published observations and cited when available. The uncertainty propagation from the primary calibration standard through transfer to the clinic for air-kerma strength is covered first. Uncertainties in each of the brachytherapy dosimetry parameters of the {TG}-43 formalism are then explored, ending with transfer to the clinic and recommended approaches. Dosimetric uncertainties during treatment delivery are considered briefly but are not included in the detailed analysis. For low- and high-energy brachytherapy sources of low dose rate and high dose rate, a combined dosimetric uncertainty is estimated, which is consistent with prior literature estimates. Recommendations are provided for clinical medical physicists, dosimetry investigators, and source and treatment planning system manufacturers. These recommendations include the use of the {GUM} and {NIST} reports, a requirement of constancy of manufacturer source design, dosimetry investigator guidelines, provision of the lowest uncertainty for patient treatment dosimetry, and the establishment of an action level based on dosimetric uncertainty. These recommendations reflect the guidance of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine ({AAPM}) and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie–European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology ({GEC}-{ESTRO}) for their members and may also be used as guidance to manufacturers and regulatory agencies in developing good manufacturing practices for sources used in routine clinical treatments.},

The mean source strength of the assayed sources must agree with the manufacturer's stated strength to within 3\%, or action must be taken to resolve the difference. Third party assays do not absolve the institutional physicist from the responsibility to perform the institutional measurement and attest to the strength of the implanted sources.

Many of these sources have satisfied the {AAPM} prerequisites for routine clinical purposes and are posted on the Brachytherapy Source Registry managed jointly by the {AAPM} and the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Houston Quality Assurance Center ({IROC} Houston). Given increasingly closer interactions among physicists in North America and Europe, the {AAPM} and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie-European Society for Radiotherapy \& Oncology ({GEC}-{ESTRO}) have prepared another supplement containing recommended brachytherapy dosimetry parameters for eleven low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. The current report presents consensus datasets approved by the {AAPM} and {GEC}-{ESTRO}. The following sources are included: 125I sources ({BEBIG} model I25.S17, {BEBIG} model I25.S17plus, {BEBIG} model I25.S18, Elekta model 130.002, Oncura model 9011, and Theragenics model {AgX}100); 103Pd sources ({CivaTech} Oncology model {CS}10, {IBt} model 1031L, {IBt} model 1032P, and {IsoAid} model {IAPd}-103A); and 131Cs ({IsoRay} Medical model {CS}-1 Rev2). Observations are included on the behavior of these dosimetry parameters as a function of radionuclide. Recommendations are presented on the selection of dosimetry parameters, such as from societal reports issuing consensus datasets (e.g., {TG}-43U1, {AAPM} Report \#229), the joint {AAPM}/{IROC} Houston Registry, the {GEC}-{ESTRO} website, the Carleton University website, and those included in software releases from vendors of treatment planning systems. Aspects such as timeliness, maintenance, and rigor of these resources are discussed. Links to reference data are provided for radionuclides (radiation spectra and half-lives) and dose scoring materials (compositions and mass densities). The recent literature is examined on photon energy response corrections for thermoluminescent dosimetry of low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources. Depending upon the dosimetry parameters currently used by individual physicists, use of these recommended consensus datasets may result in changes to patient dose calculations. These changes must be carefully evaluated and reviewed with the radiation oncologist prior to their implementation.},

	shorttitle = {Redesign of Process Map to Increase Efficiency},
	abstract = {Purpose
To increase intra-procedural efficiency in the use of clinical resources and to decrease planning time for cervical-cancer brachytherapy treatments through redesign of the procedure’s process map.

Methods and Materials
A multi-disciplinary team identified all tasks and associated resources involved in cervical-cancer brachytherapy in our institution, and arranged them in a process map. A redesign of the treatment planning component of the process map was conducted with the goal of minimizing planning time. Planning time was measured on 20 consecutive insertions, of which 10 were performed with standard procedures and 10 with the redesigned process map, and results compared. Statistical significance (p {\textless}0.05) was measured with a 2-tailed T-test.

Results
Twelve tasks involved in cervical-cancer brachytherapy treatments were identified. The process map showed that in standard procedures, the treatment planning tasks were performed sequentially. The process map was redesigned to specify that contouring and some planning tasks are performed concomitantly. Some quality assurance ({QA}) tasks were reorganized to minimize adverse effects of a possible error on procedure time. Test “dry runs” followed by live implementation confirmed the applicability of the new process map to clinical conditions. A 29\% reduction in planning time (p {\textless}0.01) was observed with the introduction of the redesigned process map.

Conclusions
A process map for cervical-cancer brachytherapy was generated. The treatment planning component of the process map was redesigned, resulting in a 29\% decrease in planning time and a streamlining of the {QA} process.},

The aim of this study was to characterize the levels of artifacts and distortions of titanium applicators on 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}).
Methods and Materials
Fletcher-Suit-Delclos-style tandem and ovoids (T\&O) and tandem and ring applicator (T\&R) were examined. The quality assurance ({QA}) phantoms for each applicator were designed and filled with copper sulphate solution (1.5 g/l). The artifacts were quantified with the registration of corresponding computed tomography ({CT}) images. A favorable {MR} sequence was searched in terms of artifacts. Using the sequence, the artifacts were determined. The geometric distortions induced by the applicators were quantified through each registration of {CT} and {MRI} without applicators. The artifacts of T\&O were also evaluated on in vivo {MRI} datasets of 5 patients.
Results
T1-weighted {MRI} with 1-mm slice thickness was found as a favorable {MR} sequence. Applying the sequence, the artifacts at the tandem tip of T\&O and T\&R were determined as 1.5 ± 0.5 mm in a superior direction in phantom studies. In the ovoids of T\&O, we found artifacts less than 1.5 ± 0.5 mm. The artifacts of a T\&O tandem in vivo were found as less than 2.6 ± 1.3 mm on T1-weighted {MRI}, whereas less than 6.9 ± 3.4 mm on T2-weighted {MRI}. No more than 1.2 ± 0.6 mm (3.0 ± 1.5 mm) of distortions, due to a titanium applicator, were measured on T1-weighted {MRI} (T2-).
Conclusion
In 3.0-Tesla {MRI}, we found the artifact widths at the tip of tandem were less than 1.5 ± 0.5 mm for both T\&O and T\&R when using T1-weighted {MRI} in phantom studies. However, exclusive 3.0-Tesla {MRI}-guided brachytherapy planning with a titanium applicator should be cautiously implemented.},

	abstract = {The use of brachytherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer has increased worldwide since its initial introduction over 100 years ago. However, certain aspects of the use of high-dose-rate ({HDR}) versus low-dose-rate ({LDR}) brachytherapy continue to be controversial, particularly the role of {HDR} in {FIGO} Stage {III} cervical cancer and the use of {HDR} with concurrent chemotherapy. This study represents a systematic literature review of prospective and retrospective series of patients with cervical carcinoma treated with external-beam radiation ({EBRT}) followed by either {HDR} or {LDR} radiation. The local control rates, survival rates, and treatment-related complications in patients with Stage {III} cervical cancer treated with {HDR} or {LDR} and those treated with concomitant chemotherapy are examined. Patients with Stage {III} cervical cancer treated with {EBRT} and brachytherapy have a local control rate of {\textgreater}50\% in most series. Randomized prospective and retrospective studies show overall statistically equivalent local control, overall survival, and complication rates between {HDR} and {LDR}. However, {LDR} may be preferable for large, bulky tumors at the time of brachytherapy. Retrospective studies of {HDR} and concurrent chemotherapy are limited but have demonstrated toxicity rates similar to those with {LDR}. Selected patients with Stage {III} cervical carcinoma who have an adequate response to {EBRT} and concomitant chemotherapy may be treated with {HDR} brachytherapy. The existing literature shows no significant increase in complications in patients treated with {HDR} and concurrent chemotherapy; however, sufficient tumor shrinkage prior to {HDR} and careful monitoring of the dose to the normal tissues are imperative.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2010 (Issue 7).Carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the second most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death among women. Radiotherapy has been used successfully to treat cervical cancer for nearly a century. The combination of external beam radiotherapy ({EBRT}) and intracavity brachytherapy ({ICBT}) has become a standard treatment for cervical cancer. Whether high dose rate ({HDR}) or low dose rate ({LDR}) brachytherapy improves outcomes in terms of local control rates, survival and complications for women with cervical cancer remains controversial.
{OBJECTIVES}: To assess the efficacy and safety of {HDR} versus {LDR} {ICBT} in combination with {EBRT} for women with uterine cervical cancer.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), {MEDLINE} (1966 to March 2014), {EMBASE} (1974 to March 2014), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database ({CBM}) (1978 to March 2014) for relevant original, published trials.
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}) and quasi-{RCTs} that compared {HDR} with {LDR} {ICBT}, combined with {EBRT}, for women with locally advanced uterine cervical cancer.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two authors independently extracted the data using standardised forms. Primary outcome measures included overall survival ({OS}), relapse-free survival ({RFS}) and pelvic control rate, while secondary outcomes included rates of recurrence and complications.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Four studies involving 1265 women met the inclusion criteria. In our meta-analysis to compare {HDR} and {LDR} {ICBT}, the pooled risk ratios ({RRs}) were 0.95 (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.79 to 1.15), 0.93 (95\% {CI} 0.84 to 1.04) and 0.79 (95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.20) for 3-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates respectively; and 0.95 (95\% {CI} 0.84 to 1.07) and 1.02 (0.88 to 1.19) for 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival ({DSS}) rates respectively. The {RR} for {RFS} was 1.04 (95\% {CI} 0.71 to 1.52) and 0.96 (95\% {CI} 0.81 to 1.14) at 3- and 5- years. For local control rates the {RR} was 0.95 (95\% {CI} 0.86 to 1.05) and 0.95 (95\% {CI} 0.87 to 1.05) at 3- and 5- years; with a {RR} of 1.09 (95\% {CI} 0.83 to 1.43) for locoregional recurrence, 0.79 (95\% {CI} 0.40 to 1.53) for local and distant recurrence, 2.23 (95\% {CI} 0.78 to 6.34) for para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and 0.99 (95\% {CI} 0.72 to 1.35) for distance metastasis. For bladder, rectosigmoid and small bowel complications, the {RR} was 1.33 (95\% {CI} 0.53 to 3.34), 1.00 (95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.91) and 3.37 (95\% {CI} 1.06 to 10.72) respectively. These results indicated that there were no significant differences except for increased small bowel complications with {HDRs} (P = 0.04).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Since the last version of this review, no new studies were identified for inclusion in this review to provide additional information. This review showed no significant differences between {HDR} and {LDR} {ICBT} when considering {OS}, {DSS}, {RFS}, local control rate, recurrence, metastasis and treatment related complications for women with cervical carcinoma. Due to some potential advantages of {HDR} {ICBT} (rigid immobilization, outpatient treatment, patient convenience, accuracy of source and applicator positioning, individualized treatment) we recommend the use of {HDR} {ICBT} for all clinical stages of cervix cancer. The overall risk of bias was high for the included studies as many of the items were either of high or unclear risk. The {GRADE} assessment of the quality of the evidence was low to moderate.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To provide updated American Brachytherapy Society ({ABS}) guidelines for transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy ({PPB}).
Methods and Materials
The {ABS} formed a committee of brachytherapists and researchers experienced in the clinical practice of {PPB} to formulate updated guidelines for this technique. Sources of input for these guidelines included prior published guidelines, clinical trials, published literature, and experience of the committee. The recommendations of the committee were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the {ABS}.
Results
Patients with high probability of organ-confined disease or limited extraprostatic extension are considered appropriate candidates for {PPB} monotherapy. Low-risk patients may be treated with {PPB} alone without the need for supplemental external beam radiotherapy. High-risk patients should receive supplemental external beam radiotherapy if {PPB} is used. Intermediate-risk patients should be considered on an individual case basis. Intermediate-risk patients with favorable features may appropriately be treated with {PPB} monotherapy but results from confirmatory clinical trials are pending. Computed tomography–based postimplant dosimetry performed within 60 days of the implant is considered essential for maintenance of a satisfactory quality assurance program. Postimplant computed tomography–magnetic resonance image fusion is viewed as useful, but not mandatory.
Conclusions
Updated guidelines for patient selection, workup, treatment, postimplant dosimetry, and followup are provided. These recommendations are intended to be advisory in nature with the ultimate responsibility for the care of the patients resting with the treating physicians.},

	abstract = {Purpose
A well-established body of literature supports the use of high-dose-rate ({HDR}) brachytherapy as definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. Most of the articles describe {HDR} as a boost with adjuvant external beam radiation, but there is a growing experience with {HDR} monotherapy.
Methods and Materials
The American Brachytherapy Society has convened a group of expert practitioners and physicists to develop guidelines for the use of {HDR} in the management of prostate cancer. This involved an extensive literature review and input from an expert panel.
Results
Despite a wide variation in doses and fractionation reported, {HDR} brachytherapy provides biochemical control rates of 85–100\%, 81–100\%, and 43–93\% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancers, respectively. Severe toxicity is rare, with most authors reporting less than 5\% Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Careful attention to patient evaluation for appropriate patient selection, meticulous technique, treatment planning, and delivery are essential for successful treatment.
Conclusion
The clinical outcomes for {HDR} are excellent, with high rates of biochemical control, even for high-risk disease, with low morbidity. {HDR} monotherapy, both for primary treatment and salvage, are promising treatment modalities.},

	abstract = {Purpose
This report presents an update to the American Brachytherapy Society ({ABS}) high-dose-rate ({HDR}) brachytherapy guidelines for locally advanced cervical cancer.
Methods
Members of the {ABS} with expertise in cervical cancer formulated updated guidelines for {HDR} brachytherapy using tandem and ring, ovoids, cylinder, or interstitial applicators for locally advanced cervical cancer. These guidelines were written based on medical evidence in the literature and input of clinical experts in gynecologic brachytherapy.
Results
The {ABS} affirms the essential curative role of tandem-based brachytherapy in the management of locally advanced cervical cancer. Proper applicator selection, insertion, and imaging are fundamental aspects of the procedure. Three-dimensional imaging with magnetic resonance or computed tomography or radiographic imaging may be used for treatment planning. Dosimetry must be performed after each insertion before treatment delivery. Applicator placement, dose specification, and dose fractionation must be documented, quality assurance measures must be performed, and followup information must be obtained. A variety of dose/fractionation schedules and methods for integrating brachytherapy with external-beam radiation exist. The recommended tumor dose in 2-Gray (Gy) per fraction radiobiologic equivalence (normalized therapy dose) is 80–90Gy, depending on tumor size at the time of brachytherapy. Dose limits for normal tissues are discussed.
Conclusion
These guidelines update those of 2000 and provide a comprehensive description of {HDR} cervical cancer brachytherapy in 2011.},

Methods
A panel of members of the American Brachytherapy Society reviewed the literature, supplemented that with their clinical experience, and formulated recommendations for interstitial brachytherapy for primary or recurrent cancers in the vagina.
Results
Patients with bulky disease (approximately {\textgreater}0.5cm thick) should be considered for treatment with interstitial brachytherapy. The American Brachytherapy Society reports specific recommendations for techniques, target volume definition, and dose–fractionation schemes. Three-dimensional treatment planning is recommended with {CT} scan and/or {MRI}. The treatment plan should be optimized to conform to the clinical target volume and should reduce the dose to critical organs, including the rectum, bladder, urethra, and sigmoid colon. Suggested doses in combination with external beam radiation therapy and summated equivalent doses in 2Gy fractions are tabulated.
Conclusion
Recommendations are made for interstitial brachytherapy for vaginal cancer and recurrent disease in the vagina. Practitioners and cooperative groups are encouraged to use these recommendations to formulate treatment and dose-reporting policies. Such a process will result in meaningful outcome comparisons, promote technical advances, and lead to appropriate utilization of these techniques.},

The {ABS} endorses the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for indications for radiation therapy for patients with endometrial cancer and cervical cancer and the guidelines on quality assurance of the American Association on Physicists in Medicine. The {ABS} made specific recommendations for applicator selection, insertion techniques, target volume definition, dose fractionation, and specifications for postoperative adjuvant vaginal cuff therapy. The {ABS} recommends that applicator selection should be based on patient anatomy, target volume geometry, and physician judgment. The dose prescription point should be clearly specified. Suggested doses were tabulated for treatment with brachytherapy alone, and in combination with external beam radiation therapy, when applicable. A properly fitted brachytherapy applicator should be selected that conforms to the vaginal apex and achieves mucosal contact with optimal tumor and normal tissue dosimetry. Dose prescription points may be individually selected but doses should be reported at the vaginal surface and at 0.5-cm depth.
Conclusions
Recommendations are made for adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy. Practitioners and cooperative groups are encouraged to use these recommendations to formulate their treatment and dose reporting policies. These recommendations will permit meaningful comparisons of reports from different institutions and lead to better and more appropriate use of vaginal brachytherapy.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Advanced imaging used in combination with brachytherapy ({BT}) has revolutionized the treatment of patients with cervical cancer. We present a comprehensive review of the literature for definitive radiation with high-dose-rate ({HDR}) {BT}. In addition, we investigate potential outcome improvement with image-based brachytherapy ({IBBT}) compared to studies using traditional Point A dosing. This review extensively investigates acute and late toxicities.
Methods and Materials
This study reviews the literature from 2000 to 2015 with an emphasis on modern approaches including concurrent chemotherapy ({chemoRT}), radiation, and {HDR} {BT} and {IBBT}. Descriptive statistics and pelvic control ({PC}), disease-free survival ({DFS}), and overall survival ({OS}) outcomes were calculated using weighted means to report pooled analysis of outcomes.
Results
Literature search yielded 16 prospective, 51 retrospective studies that reported survival outcomes, and 13 retrospective studies that focused on acute and late toxicity outcomes regardless of applicator type. There are 57 studies that report Point A dose specification with 33 having {chemoRT}, and 10 studies that use {IBBT}, 8 with {chemoRT}. Patients receiving radiation and {chemoRT} with {HDR} {BT} in the prospective studies, with {\textgreater}24 months followup, rates of {PC} were: for {RT}: 73\%, {SD}: 11; {CRT}: 82\%, {SD}: 8; {DFS}—{RT}: 55\%, {SD}: 10; {CRT}: 65\%, {SD}: 7; {OS}—{RT}: 66\%, {SD}: 7; {CRT}: 70\%, {SD}: 11. In the retrospective studies, the {PC} rates (weighted means) for the radiation and chemoradiation outcomes are 75\% vs. 80\%, and for {DFS}, the values were 55\% vs. 63\%, respectively. Comparing patients receiving {chemoRT} and {IBBT} to traditional Point A dose specification, there is a significant improvement in {PC} (p {\textless} 0.01) and {DFS} (p {\textless} 0.01) with {IBBT}. The range of genitourinary late toxicity reported for radiation was Grade 3: 1–6\% and for {chemoRT} 2–20\%. The range of late gastrointestinal toxicity for radiation was Grade 3: 4–11\% and for {chemoRT}, 1–11\%. For the late gynecologic toxicity, only 1 of the 16 prospective trials report a Grade 1–2 of 17\% for radiation and 9\% for {chemoRT} effects.
Conclusions
We present concise outcomes of {PC}, {DFS}, {OS}, and toxicity for cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation and {HDR} {BT}. Our data suggest an improvement in outcomes with the use of {IBBT} compared with traditional Point A dose prescriptions. In conclusion, {HDR} {BT} is a safe, effective modality when combined with {IBBT}.},

	abstract = {Image-guided brachytherapy in cervical cancer is increasingly replacing X-ray based dose planning. In image-guided brachytherapy the geometry of the applicator is extracted from the patient 3D images and introduced into the treatment planning system; a process referred to as applicator reconstruction. Due to the steep brachytherapy dose gradients, reconstruction errors can lead to major dose deviations in target and organs at risk. Appropriate applicator commissioning and reconstruction methods must be implemented in order to minimise uncertainties and to avoid accidental errors. Applicator commissioning verifies the location of source positions in relation to the applicator by using auto-radiography and imaging. Sectional imaging can be utilised in the process, with {CT} imaging being the optimal modality. The results from the commissioning process can be stored as library applicators. The importance of proper commissioning is underlined by the fact that errors in library files result in systematic errors for clinical treatment plans. While the source channel is well visualised in {CT} images, applicator reconstruction is more challenging when using {MR} images. Availability of commercial dummy sources for {MRI} is limited, and image artifacts may occur with titanium applicators. The choice of {MR} sequence is essential for optimal visualisation of the applicator. Para-transverse imaging (oriented according to the applicator) with small slice thickness (⩽5mm) is recommended or alternatively 3D {MR} sequences with isotropic voxel sizes. Preferably, contouring and reconstruction should be performed in the same image series in order to avoid fusion uncertainties. Clear and correct strategies for the applicator reconstruction will ensure that reconstruction uncertainties have limited impact on the delivered dose. Under well-controlled circumstances the reconstruction uncertainties are in general smaller than other brachytherapy uncertainties such as contouring and organ movement.},

	abstract = {The {GYN} {GEC}-{ESTRO} working group issued three parts of recommendations and highlighted the pivotal role of {MRI} for the successful implementation of 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy ({BT}). The main advantage of {MRI} as an imaging modality is its superior soft tissue depiction quality. To exploit the full potential of {MRI} for the better ability of the radiation oncologist to make the appropriate choice for the {BT} application technique and to accurately define the target volumes and the organs at risk, certain {MR} imaging criteria have to be fulfilled. Technical requirements, patient preparation, as well as image acquisition protocols have to be tailored to the needs of 3D image-based {BT}. The present recommendation is focused on the general principles of {MR} imaging for 3D image-based {BT}. Methods and parameters have been developed and progressively validated from clinical experience from different institutions ({IGR}, Universities of Vienna, Leuven, Aarhus and Ljubljana) and successfully applied during expert meetings, contouring workshops, as well as within clinical and interobserver studies. It is useful to perform pelvic {MRI} scanning prior to radiotherapy (“Pre-{RT}-{MRI} examination”) and at the time of {BT} (“{BT} {MRI} examination”) with one {MR} imager. Both low and high-field imagers, as well as both open and close magnet configurations conform to the requirements of 3D image-based cervical cancer {BT}. Multiplanar (transversal, sagittal, coronal and oblique image orientation) T2-weighted images obtained with pelvic surface coils are considered as the golden standard for visualisation of the tumour and the critical organs. The use of complementary {MRI} sequences (e.g. contrast-enhanced T1-weighted or 3D isotropic {MRI} sequences) is optional. Patient preparation has to be adapted to the needs of {BT} intervention and {MR} imaging. It is recommended to visualise and interpret the {MR} images on dedicated {DICOM}-viewer workstations, which should also assist the contouring procedure. Choice of imaging parameters and {BT} equipment is made after taking into account aspects of interaction between imaging and applicator reconstruction, as well as those between imaging, geometry and dose calculation. In a prospective clinical context, to implement 3D image-based cervical cancer brachytherapy and to take advantage of its full potential, it is essential to successfully meet the {MR} imaging criteria described in the present recommendations of the {GYN} {GEC}-{ESTRO} working group.},

To perform a retrospective analysis of recently reported brachytherapy errors to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and to compare with historical trends.
Methods
All events reported in the 2-year period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010 were categorized and analyzed. The 4 main areas of dose delivery were Gamma Knife radiosurgery, therapeutic radiopharmaceutical administration, high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and low-dose-rate brachytherapy. The different types of errors were wrong site, wrong dose, unintended exposure, lost or leaking source, or other. The causes of events were specified as the following: communication errors, equipment malfunction, human error, lack of training, or miscellaneous.
Results
One hundred and forty-seven events were found in the 2-year period. This error reporting rate far surpasses previous reports. The greatest number of events reported was for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, and the most common cause of error was human error. Wrong dose was the error that occurred most often, followed by wrong site.
Conclusions
Very simple treatment errors, such as wrong patient, or wrong side of patient treated, are still occurring. Newer, complex deliveries such as high-dose-rate partial breast irradiation and low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy also had a large number of events reported in this sampling. This report can help institutions establish needs for quality assessment and quality control processes.},

In the modiﬁcation of the {QA} procedures of Task Group-59, the additional patient-speciﬁc {QA} procedures are included to improve rapid {IGBT} workﬂow with applicator placement, imaging, planning, treatment, and applicator removal taking place in one room.
{RESULTS}: The {IGBT} workﬂow is partitioned into two groups of tasks that can be performed in parallel by two or more staff members.

	abstract = {Summary
Background and purpose
Brachytherapy ({BT}) plays a crucial role in the management of invasive cervix cancer from stage I to {IV}. Intracavitary techniques are based on afterloading devices, with different types of applicators. {CT} and/or {MRI} compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach with a better assessment of gross tumour volume ({GTV}) and definition and delineation of target volume ({CTV}) compared to traditional approaches. Accurate and reproducible delineation of {GTV}, {CTV} and {PTV}, as well as of critical organs has a direct impact on {BT} treatment planning, especially if it is possible to adapt the pear-shape isodose by optimisation using {DVH} analysis. When introducing a 3D image based approach for {GTV} and {CTV} assessment, there is a need for a common language to describe the concepts and to define the terms which are to be used.
Methods
In 2000, {GEC}-{ESTRO} decided to support 3D imaging based 3D treatment planning approach in cervix cancer {BT} with the creation of a Working Group. The task was to describe basic concepts and terms and to work out a terminology enabling various groups working in this advanced field to use a common language. The recommendations described in this report were proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric concepts of different institutions ({IGR}, Leuven, Vienna) and were stepwise validated against the background of different clinical experience.
Conclusions
As {GTV} and {CTV} for {BT} change significantly during treatment, time frame for assessment of {GTV} and {CTV} for {BT} is specified in this report: at time of diagnosis {GTVD}, {CTVD} and at time of {BT} {GTVB}, {CTVB}. Furthermore, {CTV} for {BT} is defined related to risk for recurrence: high risk {CTV} and intermediate risk {CTV}. Beside verbal descriptions detailed examples are given, partly in form of schematic drawings.},

Para-transverse imaging (oriented according to the applicator) with small slice thickness (⩽5mm) is recommended or alternatively 3D {MR} sequences with isotropic voxel sizes. Preferably, contouring and reconstruction should be performed in the same image series in order to avoid fusion uncertainties. Clear and correct strategies for the applicator reconstruction will ensure that reconstruction uncertainties have limited impact on the delivered dose. Under well-controlled circumstances the reconstruction uncertainties are in general smaller than other brachytherapy uncertainties such as contouring and organ movement.},

	abstract = {The second part of the {GYN} {GEC} {ESTRO} working group recommendations is focused on 3D dose-volume parameters for brachytherapy of cervical carcinoma. Methods and parameters have been developed and validated from dosimetric, imaging and clinical experience from different institutions (University of Vienna, {IGR} Paris, University of Leuven). Cumulative dose volume histograms ({DVH}) are recommended for evaluation of the complex dose heterogeneity. {DVH} parameters for {GTV}, {HR} {CTV} and {IR} {CTV} are the minimum dose delivered to 90 and 100\% of the respective volume: D90, D100. The volume, which is enclosed by 150 or 200\% of the prescribed dose (V150, V200), is recommended for overall assessment of high dose volumes. V100 is recommended for quality assessment only within a given treatment schedule. For Organs at Risk ({OAR}) the minimum dose in the most irradiated tissue volume is recommended for reporting: 0.1, 1, and 2cm3; optional 5 and 10cm3. Underlying assumptions are: full dose of external beam therapy in the volume of interest, identical location during fractionated brachytherapy, contiguous volumes and contouring of organ walls for {\textgreater}2cm3. Dose values are reported as absorbed dose and also taking into account different dose rates. The linear-quadratic radiobiological model—equivalent dose ({EQD}2)—is applied for brachytherapy and is also used for calculating dose from external beam therapy. This formalism allows systematic assessment within one patient, one centre and comparison between different centres with analysis of dose volume relations for {GTV}, {CTV}, and {OAR}. Recommendations for the transition period from traditional to 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy are formulated. Supplementary data (available in the electronic version of this paper) deals with aspects of 3D imaging, radiation physics, radiation biology, dose at reference points and dimensions and volumes for the {GTV} and {CTV} (adding to [Haie-Meder C, Pötter R, Van Limbergen E et al. Recommendations from Gynaecological ({GYN}) {GEC} {ESTRO} Working Group (I): concepts and terms in 3D image-based 3D treatment planning in cervix cancer brachytherapy with emphasis on {MRI} assessment of {GTV} and {CTV}. Radiother Oncol 2005;74:235–245]). It is expected that the therapeutic ratio including target coverage and sparing of organs at risk can be significantly improved, if radiation dose is prescribed to a 3D image-based {CTV} taking into account dose volume constraints for {OAR}. However, prospective use of these recommendations in the clinical context is warranted, to further explore and develop the potential of 3D image-based cervix cancer brachytherapy.},

	abstract = {Background
To investigate the clinical impact of {MRI} based cervix cancer brachytherapy combined with external beam radiochemotherapy applying dose volume adaptation and dose escalation in a consecutive group of patients with locally advanced cervix cancer.
Methods
In the period 1998–2003, 145 patients with cervix cancer stages {IB}–{IVA} were treated with definitive radiotherapy +/− cisplatin chemotherapy. Median age was 60 years. In 67 patients, the tumour size was 2–5cm, in 78 patients it was {\textgreater}5cm. In 29 cases the standard intracavitary technique was combined with interstitial brachytherapy. Total prescribed dose was 80–85Gy (total biologically equivalent dose in 2Gy fractions). Since 2001, {MRI} based treatment planning integrated systematic concepts for High Risk Clinical Target Volume ({HR} {CTV}) and organs at risk ({OAR}), biological modelling, Dose–Volume–Histogram analysis, dose–volume–adaptation (D90, D 2cm3), and dose escalation, if appropriate and feasible.
Findings
Dose volume adaptation was performed in 130/145 patients. The mean D90 during the whole period was 86Gy, with a mean D90 of 81Gy and 90Gy during the first and second period, respectively (p≪0.01). Median follow-up was 51 months. Complete remission at 3 months was achieved in 138/145 patients (95\%). Actuarial continuous complete remission for true pelvis ({CCRtp}) was 88\% at 3 years. For tumours 2–5cm, {CCRtp} was 96\% both in 1998–2000 and 2001–2003. For tumours {\textgreater}5cm it was 71\% in 1998–2000 and 90\% in 2001–2003 (p=0.05). Progression free survival ({PFS}) for true pelvis (local control) was 85\%, {PFS} for distant metastases was 80\%, both at 3 years. Local control for tumours {\textgreater}5cm was 64\% in 1998–2000 and 82\% in 2001–2003 (p=0.09) and 100\% and 96\%, respectively, for tumours 2–5cm. {PFS} for distant metastases remained the same during the two treatment periods with 79\% and 80\%. Overall survival ({OS}) was 58\%, and cancer-specific survival ({CSS}) was 68\% at 3 years. In the two different periods improvement in {OS} was from 53\% to 64\% (p=0.03) and in {CSS} from 62\% to 74\% (p=0.13). Improvement occurred only in tumours {\textgreater}5cm: {OS} 28\% versus 58\% (p=0.003); {CSS} 40\% versus 62\% (p=0.07). Actuarial late morbidity rate ({LENT} {SOMA}, grades 3 and 4) at 3 years was gastrointestinal 4\%, urinary 4\% and vaginal 5\% (stage {IIA}/{IIIA}). Gastrointestinal and urinary late morbidity (G3,G4) was 10\% in 1998–2000 and 2\% in 2001–2003.
Interpretation
In locally advanced extensive cervix cancer, local control of ⩾85\% can be achieved with low treatment related morbidity (G3/G4), when exploiting the potential of {MRI} based 3D treatment planning including dose volume adaptation and dose escalation and a combined intracavitary/interstitial brachytherapy, if appropriate. A significant impact of this improvement of local control on survival is to be expected. For locally advanced limited disease the {MRI} based approach will likely result in assuring excellent local control (⩾95\%) and in minimizing treatment related morbidity.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To determine the trends in brachytherapy use in cervical cancer in the United States and to identify factors and survival benefits associated with brachytherapy treatment.
Methods and Materials
Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) database, we identified 7359 patients with stages {IB}2-{IVA} cervical cancer treated with external beam radiation therapy ({EBRT}) between 1988 and 2009. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences between patients who received brachytherapy and those who did not from 2000 onward (after the National Cancer Institute alert recommending concurrent chemotherapy).
Results
Sixty-three percent of the 7359 women received brachytherapy in combination with {EBRT}, and 37\% received {EBRT} alone. The brachytherapy utilization rate has decreased from 83\% in 1988 to 58\% in 2009 (P{\textless}.001), with a sharp decline of 23\% in 2003 to 43\%. Factors associated with higher odds of brachytherapy use include younger age, married (vs single) patients, earlier years of diagnosis, earlier stage and certain {SEER} regions. In the propensity score-matched cohort, brachytherapy treatment was associated with higher 4-year cause-specific survival ({CSS}; 64.3\% vs 51.5\%, P{\textless}.001) and overall survival ({OS}; 58.2\% vs 46.2\%, P{\textless}.001). Brachytherapy treatment was independently associated with better {CSS} (hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.64; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.57-0.71), and {OS} ({HR} 0.66; 95\% {CI}, 0.60 to 0.74).
Conclusions
This population-based analysis reveals a concerning decline in brachytherapy utilization and significant geographic disparities in the delivery of brachytherapy in the United States. Brachytherapy use is independently associated with significantly higher {CSS} and {OS} and should be implemented in all feasible cases.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To utilize the National Cancer Data Base to evaluate trends in brachytherapy and alternative radiation therapy utilization in the treatment of cervical cancer, to identify associations with outcomes between the various radiation therapy modalities.
Methods and Materials
Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage {IIB}-{IVA} cervical cancer in the National Cancer Data Base who received treatment from January 2004 to December 2011 were analyzed. Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors associated with type of boost radiation modality used and its impact on survival.
Results
A total of 7654 patients had information regarding boost modality. A predominant proportion of patients were Caucasian (76.2\%), had stage {IIIB} (48.9\%) disease with squamous (82.0\%) histology, were treated at academic/research centers (47.7\%) in the South (34.8\%), and lived 0 to 5 miles (27.9\%) from the treating facility. A majority received brachytherapy (90.3\%). From 2004 to 2011, brachytherapy use decreased from 96.7\% to 86.1\%, whereas intensity modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) and stereotactic body radiation therapy ({SBRT}) use increased from 3.3\% to 13.9\% in the same period (P{\textless}.01). Factors associated with decreased brachytherapy utilization included older age, stage {IVA} disease, smaller tumor size, later year of diagnosis, lower-volume treatment centers, and facility type. After controlling for significant factors from survival analyses, {IMRT} or {SBRT} boost resulted in inferior overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.86; 95\% confidence interval, 1.35-2.55; P{\textless}.01) as compared with brachytherapy. In fact, the survival detriment associated with {IMRT} or {SBRT} boost was stronger than that associated with excluding chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 1.61′ 95\% confidence interval, 1.27-2.04′ P{\textless}.01).
Conclusions
Consolidation brachytherapy is a critical treatment component for locally advanced cervical cancer; however, there has been declining utilization of brachytherapy. Increased use of {IMRT} and {SBRT} boost coupled with increased mortality risk should raise concerns about utilizing these approaches over brachytherapy.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
To elaborate a method for applicator reconstruction for {MRI}-based brachytherapy for cervical cancer.
Materials and methods
Custom-made plastic catheters with a copper sulphate solution were made for insertion in the source channels of {MR}-{CT} compatible applicators: plastic and titanium tandem ring applicators, and titanium needles. The applicators were {CT} and {MR} scanned in a phantom for accurate 3D assessment of applicator visibility and geometry. A reconstruction method was developed and evaluated in 19 patient {MR} examinations with ring applicator (plastic: 14, titanium: 5). {MR} applicator reconstruction uncertainties related to inter-observer variation were evaluated.
Results
The catheters were visible in the plastic applicator on T1-weighted images in phantom and in 14/14 clinical applications. On T2-weighted images, the catheters appeared weaker but still visible in phantom and in 13/14 {MR} clinical applications. In the titanium applicator, the catheters could not be separated from the artifacts from the applicator itself. However, these artifacts could be used to localize both titanium ring applicator (5/5 clinical applications) and needles (6/6 clinical applications). Standard deviations of inter-observer differences were below 2mm in all directions.
Conclusion
3D applicator reconstruction based on {MR} imaging could be performed for plastic and titanium applicators. Plastic applicators proved well to be suited for {MRI}-based reconstruction. For improved practicability of titanium applicator reconstruction, development of {MR} applicator markers is essential. Reconstruction of titanium applicator and needles at 1.5T {MR} requires geometric evaluations in phantoms before using the applicator in patients.},
