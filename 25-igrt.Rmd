## Cyber Knife
A linear accelerator in CyberKnife generates a 6 MV x-ray beam. The microwave frequency it uses for accelerating electrons is in the range of:  a) 500 to 1,000 MHz b) 2 to 4 GHz c) 8 to 12 GHz d) 15-20 GHz

2016 AAPM Annual Meeting [TG180: Image Guidance Doses Delivered During RT](https://www.aapm.org/education/sams/Default.asp?v=true&mid=115&qid=2396)

- recommends a dose threshold beyond which imaging dose be accounted
for: **5% of therapeutic target dose**

### MV imaging

- EPID: 1 - 5 cGy/pair of orthogonal portals
- MVCT (TOMO): 1 - 3 cGy typical
- MV-CBCT: 2- 12 cGy typical

### kV imaging

- kV DR: 0.1 - 1.0 cGy/pair of orthogonal beams
- kV-CBCT: Soft tissue: 0.1 - 3 cGy/acquisition; Bone: 0.3 - 6 cGy/acquisition; D~bone~ is about 2-4 times D~{soft tissue}~
- kV-CBCT(4D): differs from (3D), depends on protocol used


### Comparison

- SNR: kV > 2.5 MV > 6 MV; kV images provide best image quality per unit dose
- The 2.5 MV beam had excellent contrast at a lower dose than 6 MV and may be superior to kV for difficult to image areas that include large changes in anatomical thickness. Varain 2.5 MV (Nitsch P, Robertson D, Balter P, Med Phys 42, 3266 (2015))
