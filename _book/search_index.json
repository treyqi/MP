Further, if a given physical dose is spread evenly over 24 h instead of 2 min, its effect is reduced by 20% for most tumors, but to about 1/2 for late complications. - Jack F. Folwer 30.1 7-Step to LQ heaven E - \\(ln\\) of the number of cell sterilized \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\alpha d+\\beta d^2 \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\alpha\\) is the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells, \\(ln\\) of the number of cells sterilized per Gy in a non-repairable way. (But this may be altered due to the existence of oxygen during irradition). \\(\\beta\\) is the repairable portion of the radiation damage, requiring 6 hours or more for complete repair. This means that the damage gradually fades. As more treatments are fractioned, the total cell sterilization will become ( If there is only one fraction, should we drop the \\(\\beta\\) term?): \\[\\begin{equation} E = n(\\alpha d+\\beta d^2) \\tag{30.1} \\end{equation}\\] Move dose outsied the parethesis \\[\\begin{equation} E = nd(\\alpha +\\beta d) \\tag{30.2} \\end{equation}\\] If we divide \\(\\alpha\\) on each side, 30.2 BED \\[\\begin{equation} E/\\alpha = nd(1+\\beta d/\\alpha) \\tag{30.3} \\end{equation}\\] Express E with \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\) Because we normallly only know \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\), the equation becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{E}{\\alpha} = nd(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}) \\tag{30.4} \\end{equation}\\] Biological EFFECTIVE Dose (BED), proposed by Baredsen (1982), is defined as the \\(E/\\alpha\\). Values of \\(\\alpha\\) iteself depends on many parameters such as tumor size, stage of tumor, and accuracy of dose, and etc. The term \\((1 + d/{\\alpha/\\beta})\\) is called realtive effectiveness (RE). It is low for small \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\)’s, low fraction doses, and low dose-rates (&lt; 100 cGy/h; for the pulsed low dose rate radiotherapy, the approximate dose rate is about 100 cGy/h; where can we find the dose-rate term in BED?). Overall treatment time \\[\\begin{equation} E = nd(\\alpha + \\beta d) - (T - T_k)\\times \\text{rate of reporpulation per day}, \\tag{30.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} E = nd(\\alpha + \\beta d) - ln2 (T - T_k)/T_p, \\tag{30.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} BED = \\frac{E}{\\alpha} = nd\\left(1+\\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) - \\frac{0.693}{\\alpha T_p}(T - T_k), \\tag{30.7} \\end{equation}\\] E is log cell kill \\(\\alpha\\) is the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells, defined as how many lns are killed (sterilized) per Gy, in a non-repairable way. \\(\\beta\\) is the repairable portion of the radiation damage, requiring 6 hours or more for complete repair. T is the overall time Tk is the kick-off or onset time Tp is the average cell-number doubling time BED can be expressed as Gy3 (or Gy2) for late complications, or as Gy10 (or Gyx) for tumor or early normal-tissue reactions, the subscript referring to the \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\) of the relevant tissue used in its calculation. RE is also naturally low for hyperfractionation (more and smaller fractions) and for low dose-rates (lower than 100 cGy/h; 30.3 Introduction EQD: Biologicallly EQUIVALENT** total Dose, usually in 2 Gy dose fractions. The total dose of a schedule in question gives the same log cell kill as the schedule in 2 Gy dose fractions. The phantom of immunological response keeps rearing its head, with little practical effect … Practical now? Radiation sterilizes cells, meaning that they do not die immediately, but at the time of the next cell division, or a few divisions later. Why? The BED can be calculated by: BED can be expressed as Gy3 (or Gy2) for late complications, or as Gy10 (or Gyx) for tumor or early normal-tissue reactions, the subscript referring to the \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\) of the relevant tissue used in its calculation. 30.3.1 Cell survival curve After radiation, the surviving proportion (S) can be written as \\[ lnS=-\\alpha d-\\beta d^2 \\] where D0 is the average dose that sterilize one cell. If we take \\(ln\\) on both sides, we have \\[\\begin{equation} lnS=-D/D_0. \\tag{30.8} \\end{equation}\\] This would be called “one-hit” curve. "]
