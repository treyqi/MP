Isotope Isotone Isobar Isomer (same A, Z, N but different energy (meta)states; eg \\(_{43}^{99m}Tc\\) is in metastable3 state and \\(^{99}_{43}Tc\\) is in stable state) 1.4 Stability The stability depends on the ratio of neutron and proton (see Figure 1) Figure 1.1: Stability of isotopes 1.5 Mass Defect The mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons. This “missing mass” is known as the mass defect. For example, the mass defect of a 12C atom can be calculated by: \\[ 6 \\times m_p + 6 \\times m_n + 6 \\times m_e - m_{C} = 0.0988\\ amu\\] where \\(m_C = 12\\) (the ratio of mass to 1 amu). The complete list of mass number can be found in the NIST database. The mass defect is closed related to nuclear bind energy. If we divide the above energy by 12 and times 931.5 MeV/amu, we obtain the bind energy per neuleio for 12C is 7.67 (see figure below) Figure 1.2: Nuclear binding energy per nucleon (The image is from wiki) A complete table of nuclear bind energies can be found on Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (link). 1.6 High energy charged particles The mass of a moving particle (not a photon) depends on its velocity \\(\\upsilon\\) and its rest mass \\(m_0\\). \\[\\begin{equation} E_{total} = mc^2 = \\frac{m_0c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\upsilon^2}{c^2}}} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} E_{total} = E_{rest}+E_{K.E} \\end{equation}\\] For an electron and a proton accelerated to the velocity of 0.96 c, the kinetic energy will be about 2 MeV and 2400 MeV. Therefore, high energy electrons coming out of linac head will have the speed close to the speed of light. To achieve similar high speed, you need give much more energy to a proton than an electron. 1.7 High energy photons The energy of a photon is given by \\[\\begin{equation} E = h\\cdot v \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] where h is the Planck constant, \\(v\\) is the frequency in unit of s{-1}. Or \\[\\begin{equation} E (eV) = \\frac{1.24\\times 10^{6}}{\\lambda (m)}, \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] 1.8 Electron Shell Principal quantum number (\\(n = 1, 2, 3, ...\\) or K, L, M, …) – the main energy level (or shell) occupied by an electron. The energy can be calculated by\\[E_n=\\frac{Z^2{\\hbar}^2}{2m_0\\alpha^2_Bn^2},\\] where \\(\\alpha_B\\) is the Bohr radius (\\(5.29 \\times 10^{-11}m\\)). The K shell (binding) energy for Lead, Tungsten, and Carbon are 88, 69.5, and 0.28 KeV. Secondary quantum number (\\(l = s, p, d, ...\\)) – the energy sublevel (angular monentum) occupied by the electron. Magnetic quantum number (\\(m_l = -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l\\)) – the number of possible orientations (projections) for each of energy sublevels. Spin quantum number (\\(m_s=-1/2, 1/2\\)) – the two possible orientations that an electron can have in the presence of a magnetic field. 1.9 Solutions Q1: a), c), (e) see Section 1.2 Q2: b), d); a) is wrong because they are isotopes; c) is wrong because they are isobars.

He also won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908 “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances”. He discovered three types of radiation: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and later \\(\\gamma\\) radiation.↩ In 1913, Bohr proposed a theory for the hydrogen atom based on quantum theory that (a) electrons orbit around the nucleus; (b) electrons orbits at a certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus without radiation and energy loss; (c) electrons can only gain and lose energy by jumping from one allowed orbit to another, absorbing or emitting electromagnetic radiation with a frequency: \\(v=\\frac{E_m-E_n}{h}\\). He won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1922.↩ \\(\\color{Green}{Metastable}\\) state is an excited state of an atom that has a longer lifetime than the ordinary excited states but generally has a shorter lifetime than the lowest, often stable, energy state, called the ground state. britannica↩ "],

Becquerel when he wa 44 years old.4 He received 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Maria and Pierre Curie. Radiation Sources (Siebers 2009 AAPM talk) Radioactive decay (Chapter 2) Alpha-decay Beta-decay (Section 23.4) Electron capture Isometric transitions Gamma-ray Atomic energy transitions Characteristic x-rays Auger electrons Accelerated charge particles Direct (electrons, protons) x-ray generators (synchrotron radiation (magnetic field), Bremmstrahlung) Interaction products (?) 2.1 Decay (disintegration) General balance equations of radioactive decay \\[\\begin{equation} _Z^A P = ^{A-A_R}_{Z-Z_R}D + _{Z_R}^{A_R}R + \\sum Q, \\end{equation}\\] where P and D stand for parent and daughter element, R for radiation, and Q is reaction energy (\\(\\sum Q = M_P-M_D-M_R\\)). To find out the Q-value, you can use a online Q-calculator (http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/qcalc/). Atoms found in nature are either stable or unstable. An atom is unstable (radioactive) if these forces are unbalanced if the nucleus has an excess of internal energy.5 The instability of a radionuclide may result from an excess of either neutrons or protons. Radionuclides attempt to reach stability through ejecting neutrons and protons (C area; Alpha-decay); converting one to the other with ejection of a beta particle or positron (B area; Beta decay); the release of additional energy by photon emission (Gamma decay). Alpha-decay occurs in nuclides with atomic numbers above 82 (only the first 92 occur naturally) and where the ratio of neutrons to protons is low, thus resulting in the repulsive coulomb force of the protons overcoming the attractive strong nuclear force. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\underline{\\text{Example}} &amp; _{88}^{226}Ra\\rightarrow _{86}^{222}Rn +_2^4\\alpha +\\gamma +Q \\end{matrix} \\] Beta-decay, a neutron within the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron and an antineutrino are emitted, or a proton is converted into a neutron, and a positron and a neutrino are emitted. The forces responsible for the \\(\\beta\\)-decay are weak (referred to as weak nuclear force) compared with both the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force among the nucleons. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\underline{\\text{Example}} &amp; \\begin{matrix} \\beta^-\\ \\text{decay}&amp; _{60}^{27}Co\\rightarrow _{27}^{60}Ni^{*} +\\beta^- + \\bar\\nu \\\\ \\beta^+\\ \\text{decay} &amp; _{9}^{18}F\\rightarrow _{8}^{18}O +\\beta^+ +\\nu + 1.022\\ \\text{MeV} \\end{matrix} \\end{matrix} \\] Neutrino (\\(\\nu\\)) and anti-neutrino (\\(\\bar \\nu\\)) results in spectrum of \\(\\beta\\) energies, and they are non-ionizing particles so we don’t consider them in dose calculation. Electron capture (EC) is an alternative to positron decay. In this process, an electron, usually in the K shell, is captured within the nucleus and combined with a proton to create a neutron. Electron capture most often is followed by characteristic x-ray or Auger electron. Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy level. These \\(\\gamma\\)-rays are identical to the x-rays emitted by excited atoms, except that \\(\\gamma\\)-rays originate from within the nucleus and x-rays originate from outside the nucleus. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\underline{\\text{Example}} &amp; _{27}^{60}Ni^{*} \\text{ decay to stable }_{27}^{60}Ni \\text{ by emitting two } \\gamma \\text{-rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV.} \\end{matrix} \\] The decay scheme can be found (http://atom.kaeri.re.kr:8080/gamrays.html) 2.2 Activity The activity (A) of a sample is the average number of disintegrations (decay) per second, \\[\\begin{equation} A = \\frac{\\Delta N}{\\Delta t} = \\lambda N, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the decay constant which is the probability that a nucleus will decay per second. Remember that Radioactive decay is a stochastic process. We can find certain laws only by observing a large number of events (decays here). From the equation above, we can obtain the radioative decay law at a certain time \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} A = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}. \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] More frequently, we use half-life time (\\(T_{1/2}\\)) instead of the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\). Their reqlationship is \\[\\begin{equation} T_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda}. \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] The mean or average life is the (arithmetic) average lifetime for the decay of radioactive atomes. \\[\\begin{equation} T_{a} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = 1.44T_{1/2}. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] 2.3 Unit The SI unit for radioactivity is Becquerel (Bq). The historic unit for radioactivity is Curie (Ci), and 1g of radium is 1 Ci. The relationship between Curie and Becquerrel is \\[\\begin{equation} 1\\ Ci = 3.7 \\times 10^{10} \\ Bq \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] In practice, the more frequently used formula is \\[\\begin{equation} \\boxed {1\\ \\text{GBq} = 27\\ \\text{mCi}} \\end{equation}\\] 2.4 Solutions Q1 Decays Using Eq.

Because cathod-ray tubes cannot generate reliable and high-intensity x-ray, Coolidge developed the “hot cathode” x-ray tube in 1913, in which a wire filament was heated with electrical current to release electrons by the process of thermionic emission. First medical X-ray by Wilhelm Röntgen of his wife Anna Bertha Ludwig’s hand. (The image is from wiki) The Coolidge tube was the prototype for x-ray tubes in use today. 3.1.1 Conventional x-ray tubes The basic components of a useful x-ray tube include: (a) electron source, (b) high voltage supply, (c) target for x-ray production, (d) vacuum, and (e) collimator. Electron Source Tungsten (melting point is 3370 oC). The filament is housed within a negatively charged focusing cup. With high voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are attracted to the target (anode) without electrons pile-up around the filement. In this scenerio, the tube is operated in the mode of filament-emission limited. With lower voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are not pulled immediately to the target. The accumulated electrons (space charge) will prevent additional electrons leaving the filament and therefor limit the tube current. Under this condition, the tube is operated in the mode of space-charge limited (e.g. mammography machine).

Lawrence 1932 Betatron Donald W. Kerst 1940 Cobalt machine Linear accelerator 1950s Gamma knife Lars Leksell 1968 4.2 Waveguide Figure 4.1: a simple schematic of a linear accelerator 4.3 Microwave amplifier The possibly best simple explanation about how a klystron amplifier and microwave oscillators work can be found on YouTube. A Klystron is a microwave (300 MHz – 300 GHz) amplifier tube that makes use of two (or more for better bunching result) resonant cavities. For a simple two cavity Klystron, The first resonance cavity is energized by very low-power microwaves through a coaxial cable. The microwave will cause alternating “E” fields across the gap between left and right cavity wall. As the electrons from the accelerated through the first cavity, half of them will be decelerated and the other help will accelerate (velocity modulation), and thus form electron bunches as they drift towards the second cavity. The Catcher cavity is resonant at the arrival frequency of the bunch. This will generates a retarding “E” field for slowing down electrons and in turn the electrons give their energies in the form of high-power microwaves (more electrons in a bunch \\(\\rightarrow\\) more kinetic energy \\(\\rightarrow\\) more EM energies induced in the 2nd resonant cavity). Figure 4.2: how a klystron works A Magnetron is a device that produces microwaves. The electrons emitted from the heated cathode are accelerated by the pulse electric field, EP, toward the anode across the evacuated drift space between cathode and anode. A static magnetic field, H, is applied perpendicular to the cross section of the device. The accelerated electrons induce an additional charge distribution shown on the anode poles and an electric field Em of microwave frequency between adjacent segments of the anode (similar to that in the catcher cavity of the klystron). Figure 4.3: how a magnetron works 4.4 Microwave frequency The microwave pulse frequency in most medical linear accelerators is about 3 GHz, which falls into the category of IEEE S-band (2-4 GHz, Wiki). The Mobetron and Cyberknife machines use higher frequency (8-12 GHz, categorized as in IEEE X band, for compact design (Hanna 1999 Applications of X-band Technology in medical accelerators). 4.5 Penumbra The term Penumbra means the region, at the edge of a radiation beam, over which the dose rate changes rapidly as function of lateral distance. The overall penumbra was contributed from three sources:  Geometric penumbra is caused by the source (or focal spot) having a finite size and the location of the collimator. It can be reduced by decreasing the focal spot and move the collimator closer to the patient (e.g. Varian tertiary MLC). Transmission penumbra is caused by photons transmitted through the edge of the collimator. It can be reduced by aligning the collimator following the beam divergence (e.g. X and Y photon jaws). Physical (total) penumbra is the combination of transmission, geometric penumbra, and lateral scatter of radiation (photon and electrons) within the patient. Lateral electron disequilibrium (# of electrons projected laterally outward ≠ (# of electrons projected laterally inward). Because the range of these laterally projected electrons increases as energy increases, higher energy beams have a slightly greater penumbra than low energy beams. "],

Excerpt from Niroomand-Rad: In a Siemens machine, the electron beams pass through dual scattering foils. The first (primary) foil, made of stainless steel, serves to scatter the electron beam. Its thickness is 0.075 mm for 5-7 MeV beam and 0.030 mm for 10 MeV beams. The second (secondary) foil, made of 0.8 mm thick aluminum, for all the electron beams, produces a homogeneous radiation mainly by absorption.

For electrons in the range of 1-25 MeV, the range of the backscattered electrons is about 1-2 g/cm2 of polystyrene (see TG-70 table IV below). Example 3.1 A buccal mucosa lesion is treated with a 9 MeV electron beam incident externally on the cheek. Assuming cheek thickness including the lesion, to be 2 cm, calculate (1) the thickness of lead required to shield oral structures beyond the cheek; (2) magnitude of electron backscatter, and (3) thickness of bolus or aluminum to absorb backscattered electrons. (1) Electron energy at depth z, \\(E_z = E_0(1 - z/R_p)\\) ~ 5 MeV, lead thickness is 5/2 = 2.5 mm. (2) For the polystyrene-lead interface, the electron backscatter factor (EBF) can be calculated as , and thus EBF = 1.57 or 57% backscattering. 14.7 Total skin electron irradiation (TSEI) The total skin irradiation (TSI) is one of the most efficient techniques in the treatment of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). (Diamantopoulos) Its purpose is to deliver the prescribed dose (average 36 Gy over 18 fractions) to patient skin, without damaging any healthy organ. The main prerequisite for TSE installation is a linear accelerator capable of producing large (200 cm x 80 cm) and uniform fields (acceptable variation of dose distribution: ± 8% vertically and ± 4% horizontally within the central 160 cm x 60 cm field area according to AAPM TG-30) of relatively low energy electrons (4-10 MeV at the exit window, 3-7 MeV at patient’s surface) at an extensive SSD. Our institutional experience Treatment: Dose rate: 2500 MU/min (Truebeam High Dose Electron) or 900 MU/min (Artiste) Energy: 6 MeV technique: large-field technique - 6 patient positions, and two gantry angles per position Schedule: 6 beam per day; wear paper short Protection: Finger and toe nail shields Internal eye shields TG-51 was performed on this beam, with the machine output adjusted to 1cGy/MU at the depth of 1.3 cm deep (dmax) with 100 cm SSD with a 15 x 15 cm2 cone. The TG-51 setup was replaced with solid water and a PTW 23343 Markus chamber. A transfer factor was established for this chamber, 0.019675 nC/cGy. The gantry was then angled to 270° and the chamber placed a varying extended distances from the isocenter. At 330 cm SSD an acceptable dose rate was found, 59 cGy/min, without reducing field size and uniformity. Film was placed on the back side of the scatter screen at 330 cm SSD. The film was irradiated with 450 MU, with varying sets of beam angles. A ±10% uniformity was achieved using beam angles of 253° and 287°, over a height of 200 cm (figure 1). The patient treatment will then be 12 beams. The patient will be treated by the two gantry angles at each of 6 positions, 3 one day, 3 the next, per fraction. The patient will face the accelerator (AP beams) and be irradiated by 253° and 287° gantry angle beams. The patient will then rotate 120° (RPO), receive the two beams again, then rotate 120° (LPO) for the last two beams. The next day the patient will face away from the accelerator (PA), then rotate 120° (LAO), and again (RAO). A 1 cm thick scatter screen will be placed at 310 cm SSD. A cylindrical phantom, 30 cm in diameter was then placed at 330 cm SSD, centered with the lasers, with the scatter screen 20 cm in front of it. Powder Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD)s were placed around the circumference of the cylinder. Additional TLDs were placed around the circumference under 5mm of wax bolus. This phantom was irradiated with the two beams, (gantry angles of 253° &amp; 287°), and then rotated 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300° about its vertical axis, irradiated at each position with the two beams. This simulates the patient treatment. Each beam was 450 MU, 6MeV at 900 MU/min, with a 33x33cm field size. The average TLD reading was 67.6 with a standard deviation of 2.8 cGy. This gives the beam calibration factor of 67.6 cGy/450 MU per beam. The TLD value was compared to the chamber measurement from the two beams, but no phantom rotation. This is 26.2 cGy/450 MU. This implies B factor of 2.58 (expect 2.5-3). The B factor represents the increase in dose due to the overlapping of the surface exposed at each phantom rotation and the oblique angle of incidence. The Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) was determined using film (figure 2), chamber (figure 3) and TLD measurements. The chamber measurements are only based on directly incident beams, ie the phantom is not rotated. They give a PDD at 5 mm of around 93%. The film and TLD measurement used all 12 beams (6 phantom positions, 2 beams per position), therefore the surface dose is greatly increased by the oblique angles of incidence of the electron beams. This reduces the PDD. The film and TLDs both see a PDD of 85% at 5 mm. PDD at 5 mm is 85%. Calibration factor: 67.6 cGy / 450 MU MU = dose per fraction / (PDD * Calibration Factor) = 200 / (0.85 * 67.6/450 ) = 1566 Patient treated on TSET stand. 1 cm thick plastic scatter plate 20 cm in front of patient. 3 cm thick plastic shield for lower half of body 3 mm thick lead shields on fingernails and eyes Stand against wall* (how you make sure SAD and SSD setup?)

The radium was supplied in the form of a salt, which was mixed with an inert filler such as magnesium oxide or barium sulfate. The small crystals of radium salt and filler were contained within cylindrical cells about 1 cm long. The cells were made of gold foil 0.1 to 0.2 mm thick and were sealed to prevent the escape of radon gas. Each source of radium contained 1 to 3 cells surrounded by a wall of platinum, reinforced with iridium (10%). The thickness (usually 0.5 or 1 mm) of the platinum-iridium wall was sufficient to absorb \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) radiation from the source. Gamma rays were attenuated only slightly by the wall. The exposure rate from a 1 mCi point source of 226Ra that is in secular equilibrium with its decay products and enclosed within a 0.5 mmPt-Ir wall is 8.25 R/hr at a distance of 1 cm. The value of 8.25 R\\(\\cdot\\)cm2/hr\\(\\cdot\\)mCi is referred to as the exposure rate constant. 15.1.2 Radium substitutes Table 15.1: Frequently used radioactive isotopes12 Isotope \\(T_{1/2}\\) (days) Median E (KeV) HVL (mm lead) usage Cs-137 30 years 660 5.5 - Ir-192 74 400 2.5 interstitial implantation (in ribbon) I-125 60 28 0.025 prostate implants (23), eye plaques Pd-103 17 22 0.01 prostate implants (23) Cs-131 10 29 - intracavitary BT of uterine cervix Au-198 2.5 400 2.5 eye plaque Y90 (\\(\\beta\\) emitter) 2.67 937 - liver radioembolism Radiation safety of brachytherapy sources Storage - shielding container; forceps, personal dosimetry Test for tumor distribution of activity - autoradiography using films (exposure distribution + source physicial position and shape) Evaluation the safety - leak test (the source is swapped with a moistened cotton swab, which is then placed into a scintellation counter) 15.2 Source strength Radium sources has been specified in terms of mass of radium Cesium sources was specified in terms of milligram equivalents of radium (mg\\(\\cdot\\)Ra\\(\\cdot\\)eq) Sources can also be specified in terms of activity; the apparent activity, of a source is determined from a measurement of the exposure rate at a distance; it describes the activity of that nuclide that would produce the same exposure rate when unencapsulated. AAPM recommend air-kerma strength 15.2.1 Unit: Air-kerma strength \\(S_k\\) Air-kerma strength (Sk) of brachytherapy sources is is defined as the air-kerma rate (\\(\\dot{K}_{\\delta}\\)) at a reference distance (e.g. 1 m) from the source center along the perpendicular bisector. The air-kerma strength is related to the quantity exposure rate by13 \\[\\begin{equation} S_k =\\dot K_\\delta \\cdot d^2 = \\dot X(d) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\bar W}{e}\\right) \\cdot d^2, \\tag{15.1} \\end{equation}\\] The SI unit of air-kerma strength Gy m2 s-1 or \\(\\mu\\)Gy m2 h-1. The exposure rate \\(\\dot X(d)\\) is measured using an ion chamber, a “reentrant”-type well chamber, or a dose calibrator supplied with a suitable standard source. The term \\(({\\bar W}/e )\\) is the averagy energy to create an ion pair (0.876 cGy/R). The international community uses the term of reference air-kerma rate (RAKR), which is defined as the air kerma rate at 1 m from the source in 𝜇Gy/hr. 15.3 Radiation dose from brachytherpay sources 15.3.1 From exposure rate Early prescriptions for brachytherapy treatments were expressed in terms of radiation exposure. The exposure rate (in R/hr) at some distance, r (cm), from a point source of radioactive material is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot X = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\delta}A}{r^2} \\tag{15.2} \\end{equation}\\] where A is the activity of the source, and \\(\\Gamma_{\\delta}\\) is the exposure rate constant for the nuclide. For example, \\(\\Gamma_{\\delta}\\) is 3.28, 4.62, 1.45, and 1.48 R\\(\\cdot\\)cm2/hr\\(\\cdot\\)mCi for 137Cs, 192Ir, 125I, and 103Pd, respectively. The resulting Sievert integral is shown \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r, \\theta) = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\delta}Af}{lr}\\int^{\\theta_2}_{\\theta_1}e^{-\\mu t/cos{\\theta}}d\\theta \\end{equation}\\] where f is the \\(f\\) factor (exposure to dose conversion), \\(l\\) is the length of source. Although the effects of photon scatter and attenuation in tissue are neglected, dose calculations can be reasonably accurate because contributions of scattered radiation to a point very nearly compensate for the tissue attenuation of radiation reaching the same point. 15.3.2 TG-43 Most brachytherapy dose calculations are now based on TG-43 and its updates14 and are done using computer programs. It should be noted that most current dose calculation still assumes that all material is water equivalent. The four principal factors influencing the relative dose distribution include: 1) Distance - a factor of 100 between the distances of 0.5 and 5 cm while the remaining factors over the same distance range rarely exceeds a factor of 2 or 3; 2) Attenuation and scattering in source structure - the dose near the longitudinal axis is usually smaller than on the transverse axis; 3) Attenuation by surrounding medium - compton scattering and photoelectric absorption; 4) Accumulation of scattering in surrounding medium. Although the manual calculation is not needed, it is helpful to understand how the dose distributions are calculated in TG-43. In TG-43, the dose rate distribution around a sealed brachytherapy source can be determined in two-dimensions (2D) using the following equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r, \\theta) = \\Lambda S_k \\frac{G_L(r, \\theta)}{G_L(r=1cm,\\theta=90^o)} g_L(r, \\theta) F(r,\\theta), \\tag{15.3} \\end{equation}\\] or a simplified 1D version \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r) = \\Lambda S_k \\frac{1}{r^2} G_p(r)\\phi_{an}(r), \\tag{15.4} \\end{equation}\\] where r denotes the distance (cm) from the center of the active source to the point of interest and \\(\\theta\\) is the point of interest relative to the source longitudinal axis. TG 43 Dose rate constant The dose-rate constant is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Lambda = \\frac{\\dot D(r_0, \\theta_0)}{S_k}. \\tag{15.5} \\end{equation}\\] It can be thought as the dose rate in water at a reference point (\\(r_0\\) = 1 cm for photon sources and 2 mm for beta emitters) along the transverse axis (\\(\\theta = 90^{\\circ }\\)) for source strength of 1 U. Radial dose function and geometry function The radial dose function g(r) represents the attenuation of radiation in tissue, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} g(r) = \\frac{\\dot D(r,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r_0,90^{\\circ})}{\\dot D(r_0,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r, 90^{\\circ})}. \\end{equation}\\] where \\(G(r,\\theta)\\) is the geometry function which accounts for the effect of the distribution of radioactive material inside the source on the dose distribution at a given point. It is equal to \\(1/r^2\\) for point source approximation, \\(\\frac{tan^{-1}[(x+L/2)/y]-tan^{-1}[(x-L/2)/y]}{Ly}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{x^2-(L/2)^2}\\) for linear source approximation with \\(\\theta \\neq 0^{\\circ}\\) or \\(\\theta = 0^{\\circ}\\) and \\(x&gt;L/2\\). Anisotrpic function \\(F(r,\\theta)\\) is the anisotropy function, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} F(r,\\theta) = \\frac{\\dot D(r,\\theta)\\cdot G(r,90^{\\circ})}{\\dot D(r,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r, \\theta)}. \\end{equation}\\] It accounts for anisotropy of dose distribution around the source, including effects of absorption and scatter in medium, i.e., self-filtration in source, oblique filtration in walls, scattering and absorption in tissue. In TG-43U, typically calculated from Monte Carlo. The example information about Elekta Flexisource can be seen in the figure below In brachytherapy there is a rapid falloff in dose as distance from the source increases due to inverse square law. The dose within the tumor may much different from the prescription dose, thus the concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was introduced by Dale et al. (1997). Mathematically, the generalized EUD is defined as \\[EUD= \\left( \\sum \\nu_iD^a_i \\right ) ^{1/a}\\] Here \\(\\nu_i\\) is the fractional organ volume receiving a dose \\(D_i\\) and a is a tissue-specific parameter that describes the volume effect. \\(a \\rightarrow –\\infty\\), EUD = minimum dose; \\(a \\rightarrow –\\infty\\), EUD = maximum dose (serial organs); a = 1, EUD = mean dose; a = 2, EUD = RMS dose. The EUD model is parameterized by the single biological parameter a, which should be chosen so that the EUD reflects the intended biological properties for the given tumor or organ. Parameter a and the Lyman model parameter n are related by a = 1/n Tumor: a is a negative number (e.g., a = −15) Normal tissues: a is a positive number The volume-effect: very small normal tissue volumes (e.g. 1-2 cm3) can tolerate very high doses that larger volumes would not tolerate. There are a few exceptions to this such as spinal cord, though the dose as high as 167.3 Gy to the cord has been reported in very low dose rate brachytherapy of paraspinal tumor. Rogers et al. (2002) reported that the mean cord dose was 72.5 Gy (ranging: 53.1-167.3 Gy), combining the EBRT and I-125 brachytherapy. 15.4 Solutions Q1 d) As \\(D = \\dot D\\times\\Delta t\\), \\(\\frac{\\Delta t_{new}}{\\Delta t_{old}}=\\frac{\\dot D_{old}}{\\dot D_{new}} = \\frac{A_{old}}{A_{new}} = \\frac{A_0e^{-10/30}}{A_0} = 0.79\\) Q2 Shielding b) Although the average energy of 60Co is higher than that of 226Ra, there are gamma rays of 1.76 and 2.2 MeV emitted from 226Ra sources.

Normally, we don’t send sources to NIST or ADCL, but instead a well chamber with specific inserts designed for different isotopes. To calibrate Bard PS-1251L I-125 sources, for instance, the well chamber with an I-125 insert will be used, which was checked using Bard PS-1251L I-125 sources at NIST or ADLC. TG-40 all long half-life sources should be calibrated; at least 10% or 2 ribbons (whichever is larger) should be calibrated for a large number of loose seeds with short half-life. If the institution’s verification of source strength disagrees with the manufacturer’s data by more than 3%, the source of the disagreement should be investigated. We further recommend that an unresolved disparity exceeding 5% should be reported to the manufacturer. Radioactive materials must be under control by the facility at all times. This means under direct control or by securing in a locked area. Form the NIST table (https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/ComTab/water.html), the total attenuation coefficients in water are about 0.38, 0.1, and 0.09 cm-1 for the photon energies of 30 (I-125), 400 (Au-198 and Ir-192), and 600 KeV (Cs-137), respectively.

["protection.html", "Chapter 16 Radiation Protection 16.1 Sources of radiation exposure 16.2 Stochastic and deterministic event 16.3 TDS rule", " Chapter 16 Radiation Protection Historically, the most commonly used unit in US is millirem (mrem) where rem stands for Roentgen Equivalent Man. The SI unit of effective dose and equivalent dose is Sievert (Sv). Because 1 Sv, equal to 1 Gy numerically, is rather large quantity, the milliSievert (mSv) is commonly used in practice. The relationship between mSv and mrem is \\[1\\ mSv = 100\\ mrem\\]. 16.1 Sources of radiation exposure According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) report 160 (2009), the average annual radiation dose per person in the U.S. is about 6.2 mSv, in which medical imaging contributes about 50% (e.g. CT: 24%, NM: 12%, interventional fluoroscopy 7%, conventional radiography 5%). Naturally occurring sources of radiation include cosmic radiation (5%), radioactive minerals in the ground and in your body (5%), and terrestrial radiation emitted by naturally occurring materials such as uranium, thorium, and radon (37%) in earth. The pie chart of sources of radiation exposure from NCRP 160 can be found here. jdkhfakjdhfkljadsfdf 16.2 Stochastic and deterministic event Although the severity of the stochastic effect is independent of the dose, the probability of having such effects is proportional to the dose without dose threshold. The examples of stochastic effects include radiation induced cancer and genetic mutation. Skin erythema, epilation (hair loss), lens opacification, and tissue necrosis are best described as non-stochastic or deterministic events. For deterministic effects, there is a threshold and the severity of the effect depends on the dose. To avoid unacceptable complications, normal tissue should be below a tolerance dose (TD) (Emami et al.) Complications is categorized as fatal, severe (e.g. grade 3-4 pneumonitis), and quality-of-life complications. TD5%/5 and TD50%/5 are used to imply complications in 5 years. Answer: e) 16.3 TDS rule Time (\\(D \\propto \\dot{D}\\times \\Delta t\\)), distance (inverse square law), and shield (attenuation) measures are major factors in consideration of minimizing the unavoidable radiation exposure. Other procedures to minimize the exposure are containment and NRC’s system for radiation protection according to NRC guidelines. The NRC’s system for protection includes (1) dose limits for radiation workers and members of the public; (2) monitoring and labeling radioactive materials; (3) posting signs in and around radiation areas; and (4) reporting the theft or loss of radioactive material. In addition, the NRC imposes penalties for failures to follow the agency’s regulations. If the licensees’ can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States. Answer: d) "],

Therefore b) photon fluence and c) photon fluence are modulated as well d) the dose rate in the IMRT delivery. The choice of a) is not correct because the photon energy cannot be modulated for current linac design, although the beam energy spectrum can be changed (little) after passing through the beam modifier.

Q1: b), c) 20.3 Q4 MU: IMRT vs. 3DCRT Compared to the four-field box technique, an IMRT plan could require substantially more monitor units (MU). The MUs of an IMRT plan largely depend on the degree of dose modulation within a target and/or a proximity between a target and nearby OARs.

Linac performance for small MU delivery Leaf positional accuracy Inter- and intra-leaf leakage Tough-and-groove effect Leaf speed accuracy Solution: e Generally speaking, the MLC delivery can be categorized into two types: static (e.g., step-and-shoot) and dynamic (e.g., vmat and conformal-arc). Linac performance on small MU delivery has been a serious issue for static MLC delivery. Xia et al. (2002) has used a simple formula to relate the dose error (Δ) with dose rate (R), communication time (T), and MU/segment (M): ∆ =RT/M For example, if dose rate is 600 MU/min, T = 100 mS, and M = 1 MU/seg, the dose error 1 or 100%. Therefore, larger dose errors are expected for smaller MU segments with certain dose rate and communication time. Recent progress in increase of sampling rate (e.g., from 100 ms to 20 ms) and integration of MLC controller with the linac have significantly improved the dose delivery accuracy for step-and-shoot IMRT Li et al. (2012). In addition, as the optimization algorithms improved, the use of increased minimal MU per segment (&gt; 4-8) further reduce the dose errors caused by smaller MU segments used in the plan. Leaf positioning error impact also 20.11 Q12 The contribution of MLC leakage to the total dose from an IMRT field: Is the largest contribution of the dose Increases with increase in leaf speed Increases with increase in leaf gap width May be neglected in the final dose calculation None of the above Solution: e More Inverse planning procedures Clinical objectives (goals) are specified first in terms of desired (physical or biological ) dose or DVH goals. Field’s fluence map (the set of beamlet weights) is optimized The optimize fluence is converted to deliverable MLC positions and further optimization is continued It should be noted that the step 2 and 3 are integrated into the direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO).

To simulate the head frame used in the SRS, a body frame was used in early SBRT treatments (Sweden and Japan) in early 1990s.

How? - Practical ROP chapter “Intracavitary Brachytherapy” 22.3 HDR-QA 22.3.1 Daily QA According 10 CFR35.643, the AMP needs to review the daily QA within 15 days. 22.3.2 Pretreatment QA Based on AAPM TG-59 describs pretreatment QA for a HDR treatment. Two people (therapists?) should check proper connection of catheters to the HDR unit and that the transfer tubes are free of kinks. The emergency kit and source container are available. Survey meter and/or GM-counter is present and operational. (The patient may have had a nuclear medicine scan prior to the treatment, causing an elevated reading. thus a pre-treatment survey is conducted though not listed in TG-59). The length of transfer tube and applicator (catheters) are correct. Check applicator positioning. How do physicians check this item without image verification? Treatment documentation review. Signed prescription and plan. Second check has been performed. (use emipircal values) Plan agrees with prescription. Plan is consistent with previous fractions if applicable. Dwell positions and times in plan agree with what is programmed on the treatment console. Patient identity confirmed by two methods. At current practice, a check-list is used by physicists for pretrement plan QA and a time-out is conducted prior to initiating the treatment. 22.3.3 Source change The half-life time is about 74 days, so the old source is sawpped with a new source about every 3 months. The activity of the new source is normally about 10 Ci. According to Eq. (15.1) and Eq. (15.2), it is equal to 41100 U (\\(S_k = 10,000\\ (mCi) \\times 4.69 \\left(\\frac{{R\\cdot cm}^2}{mCi\\cdot hr} \\right) \\times 0.876 \\left(\\frac{cGy}{R}\\right)\\)). This quantity is will be verified by an autheried medical physicist using NIST tracable well chamber and electrometer, and then enterred in the treatment planning system for dose calculation. Although the well chamber (and its 192Ir insert) is still within 2-year calibration period, we always double check our chamber using a NIST-calibrated 137Cs source provided by our RSO. 22.4 Medical Events Errors on NRC website Wisconsin 22.5 Source A comprehensive seed data source can be found from a database provided by Carleton University Because [^192^Ir](https://www.estro.org/about/governance-organisation/committees-activities/tg43-ir-192-hdr) has much higher special activity than most other isotopes, it is now the mostly used radio-isotope for HDR treatment. The higher the special activity means that the 192 can be made with small physial dimension but still provide high radioactivity. The special activity (SA) is defined as the activity per mass. It depends on half lifetime and atomic number, \\(SA \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{1/2}\\cdot A}\\). For example, \\(\\frac{SA_{Co}}{SA_{Ir}} = \\frac{74\\ days \\times 192}{5\\ years \\times 60} \\approx 0.13\\). Wait a second, how about SA of 125I? Although 125I can have higher SA than 192Ir, the energy of 125I is just too low for enough tissue penetration. 22.6 Treatment sites 22.6.1 Endometrial cancer American Brachytherapy Society consensus guidelines for adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy after hysterectomy Dose fractionation: 7Gy \\(\\times\\) 3 prescribed to 0.5 cm is a common fractionation scheme with active length of 5 cm (\\(\\color{Purple} {\\text{Are we treating vaginal cuff or the whole vigina?}}\\)) the standard applicator is a segmented cylinder with one central catheter; the largest diameter cylinder that patient can tolerate is used to minimize the air gap between cylinder and vagina and to avoid rapid dose fall-off. 22.6.2 Cervical cancer American Brachytherapy Society consensus guidelines for locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix.

Based on GEC-ESTRO recommendations18, the choice of MR sequence is essential for optimal visualisation of the applicator. There are difference between plastic and titanium applicators19 Plastic has weak signal on T2; use of markers Titanium has susceptibility artifact, and thus more distortions for higher magnetic strength; worse on T2; T1 is more suitable (?) To understand artifacts (Why Titanium is MR compatible? - applicator induced susceptibility artifacts.) If an applicator has been shown to be MR conditional for a 1.5T MRI, then it does not mean that it can be safely used in a 3T system without the need for further testing. CT still provides best imaging for applicator in terms of spatial accuracy (1 mm on CT vs. 1-2 mm on MRI for the localization of first dwell position) and artifacts.
