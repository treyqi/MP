The SI unit of effective dose and equivalent dose is Sievert (Sv). Because 1 Sv, equal to 1 Gy numerically, is rather large quantity, the milliSievert (mSv) is commonly used in practice. The relationship between mSv and mrem is, 1 mSv = 100 mrem. 16.1 Regulatory agencies U.S. NRC Naturally occurring radioisotopes Reactor- and accelerator-produced radionuclides Documentation (RT-related): 10 CFR 35, Part 19, 20, and 35 States X-ray – generating machines (CT simulator and Linac) NRC regulated materials (agreement states2) FDA Manufacture and sale of machines and TPS’s (501K clearance) DOT Safe transport of radioactive materials 16.2 Sources of radiation exposure According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) report 160 (2009), the average annual radiation dose per person in the U.S. is about 6.2 mSv, in which medical imaging contributes about 50% (e.g. CT: 24%, NM: 12%, interventional fluoroscopy 7%, conventional radiography 5%). Naturally occurring sources of radiation include cosmic radiation (5%), radioactive minerals in the ground and in your body (5%), and terrestrial radiation emitted by naturally occurring materials such as uranium, thorium, and radon (37%) in earth. The pie chart of sources of radiation exposure from NCRP 160 can be found here. 16.3 Stochastic and deterministic event Although the severity of the stochastic effect is independent of the dose, the probability of having such effects is proportional to the dose without dose threshold. The examples of stochastic effects include radiation induced cancer and genetic mutation. Skin erythema, epilation (hair loss), lens opacification, and tissue necrosis are best described as non-stochastic or deterministic events. For deterministic effects, there is a threshold and the severity of the effect depends on the dose. To avoid unacceptable complications, normal tissue should be below a tolerance dose (TD) (Emami et al.) Complications is categorized as fatal, severe (e.g. grade 3-4 pneumonitis), and quality-of-life complications. TD5%/5 and TD50%/5 are used to imply complications in 5 years. 16.3.1 TDS rule Time (\\(D \\propto \\dot{D}\\times \\Delta t\\)), distance (inverse square law), and shield (attenuation) measures are major factors in consideration of minimizing the unavoidable radiation exposure. Other procedures to minimize the exposure are containment and NRC’s system for radiation protection according to NRC guidelines. The NRC’s system for protection includes (1) dose limits for radiation workers and members of the public; (2) monitoring and labeling radioactive materials; (3) posting signs in and around radiation areas; and (4) reporting the theft or loss of radioactive material. In addition, the NRC imposes penalties for failures to follow the agency’s regulations. If the licensees’ can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States. 16.3.2 ALARA 16.4 Shielding Calculation Shielding design goal, workload, use factor, occupancy factor. 16.4.1 Design goal This design goal for an uncontrolled area is 0.02 mSv/week (about 1 mSv annually for frequent or continuous exposure) or for a controlled area is 0.1 mSv/week (about 5 mSv annually – this is lower than the recommended value of 50 mSv but is based upon the ALARA principle). The primary barrier is designed and constructed to attenuation useful high energy and high dose rate beams. The most commonly used detector is a large-volume pressurized ionization chamber survey meter. Although a GM counter may be used to quickly detect shielding issue, it can’t measure radiation of high dose rates due to the “dead time” of the tub. In addition, the GM counter cannot distinguish the energy (e.g. 6 MV and 15 MV) of the incident radiation.3 16.4.2 Workload 16.4.3 Use factor 16.4.4 Occupancy factor \\[\\begin{equation} B_{pri}=\\frac{P_{pri}d_{pri}^2}{WUT} \\end{equation}\\] P: shielding design goal (controlled area: 0.1 mSv/week and uncontrolled area: 0.02 mS/week); unit: mSv/week dpri: distance from the target to the point of protection; no unit W: workload (dose) at the isocenter; unit: [mSv/week] U: use factor; T: occupancy factor \\[ B_L=\\frac{P_Ld_L^2}{0.001\\cdot WT} \\] \\[ B_{sca}=\\frac{P_{sca}}{\\alpha WT}d_{sca}^2d_{sec}^2\\frac{400}{F} \\] Figure 16.1: THe first and equivalent tenth-value layer for concrete, steel, and lead. The radiation safety committee is required by the USNRC for institutions under a type-A specific license of broad scope (10. CFR part 33.11) as a means for managerial control over licensed activities. The committee shall consist of a radiation safety officer (RSO), an authorized user, a representative of management who is neither the RSO nor an authorized user, and a nurse. There are also Type B and C specific license of broad scope for licensees in using one and/or two isotopes and limited quantities. 2017 AAPM Annual Meeting Strategies for Quality Improvement Based On RO-ILS Information If the licensees can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States.↩ A farmer-type ionization chamber is most commonly used for linac output measurements. It is not suitable for survey measurement due to its small detection volume, ~0.6cc. A scintillation detector is designed (a scintillator plus a photo-multiplier) to detect small signals. For example, a liquid scintillation counter is used to detect removable I-125 contamination on swabs. A BF3 proportional counter is most commonly used for neutron detection.
