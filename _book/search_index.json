TG-132 19.1 ICRU reference point The ICRU reference point is the point in the center (or center parts) of the PTV 19.2 Image operations 19.2.1 Glossary (TG-132) image registration — the process of determining the geometric transformation that relates identical (anatomic) points in two image series: a moving dataset (Study A) and a stationary source dataset (Study B).2 image fusion — the combined display of the mapped data from the moving dataset with the stationary dataset. 19.2.2 Techniques for image registration The registration is defined by 9 criteria: Dimensionality (2D or 3D) Nature of registration basis gemometry or feature-based metrics Inensity-based metrics Mutual information Nature of transformation rigid, affine, Domain of transformation Interaction Optimization procedure Modalities involved Subject Object 19.2.3 QA for image registration Historically, the image registration is mostly used for manual or semiautomatically segmentation. Currently, image registration has been used for adaptive treatment planning, IGRT, and response assessment. According to TG-132, the QA program should include: Validation and QA of image registration and fusion at treatment planning, treatment delivery, adaptive re‐planning, and response assessment Commissioning image registration and fusion software to ensure accuracy of the tools used Define/assign the role of each team member and tailor workflow and tolerances appropriately depending on the intended use of the image registration Clinical verification of image registration for individual patients. 19.2.4 Deformable image registration 19.3 Image segmentation http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/ibv/reader/chapter10.pdf: the division of an image into meaning structures. Wiki: image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels) Khan: slice-by-slice delineation of targets and organs-at-risk 19.4 Cumulative DVH DVH See Chapter 11 Q6 19.5 Differential DVH The choice of c): a certain dose within a specified dose interval as a function of dose. The differential DVH is similar to conventional histogram in statistics. ITK: a technique aimed to align two images using a particular transformation.↩ "]
