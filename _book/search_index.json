The important constants used in medical physics are: Avogadro constant: \\(N_A = 6.022\\times10^{23} mol^{-1}\\) Speed of light in vacuum: \\(c = 2.998\\times10^8\\ m/s\\) Atomic mass constant: \\(u = 1.661 \\times 10^{−27}\\ kg = 931.5\\ MeV/c^2\\) Elementary charge: \\(e = 1.602 \\times 10^{−19}\\ C\\) Electron rest mass: \\(m_e = 9.109 \\times 10^{−31}\\ kg = 0.5110\\ MeV/c^2\\) Proton rest mass: \\(m_p = 1.673 \\times 10^{−27}\\ kg = 1.007\\ u = 938.3 MeV/c^2\\) Neutron rest mass: \\(m_n = 1.675 \\times 10^{−27}\\ kg = 1.009\\ u = 939.6 MeV/c^2\\) Planck constant: \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{−34}\\ J\\cdot s = 4.136 \\times 10^{−15}\\ eV\\cdot s\\) The SI system of units The 7 base quantities and their units are Length: meter (m) Mass: kilogram (kg) Time: second (s)1 Electric current: ampere (A) Temperature: kelvin (K) Amount of substance: mole (mol) Luminous intensity: candela (cd) 1.2 Atomic Representation Atoms = Nucleus (neutron and protons)2 + Orbital electrons3 \\[^A_ZX\\] A (mass number) - the number of protons and neutrons Z (atomic number) - the number of proton number X (chemical element) - for the element Atomcs can be classified in terms of the same number of protons, neutrons, mass, and (meta)state. Isotope - same number of protons Isotone - same number of neutrons Isobar - same atomic number Isomer - same A, Z, N but different energy meta-states; eg \\(_{43}^{99m}Tc\\) is in metastable4 state and \\(^{99}_{43}Tc\\) is in stable state) 1.3 Stability The stability depends on the ratio of neutron and proton (see Figure 1.1) Figure 1.1: Stability of isotopes 1.4 Mass Defect The mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons. This “missing mass” is known as the mass defect. What is the mass defect of a 12C atom? It can be calculated by: \\(6 \\times m_p + 6 \\times m_n + 6 \\times m_e - m_{C} = 0.0988\\ amu,\\) where mC = 12 amu (1 atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 of the mass of an C-12 atom). The complete list of mass number can be found in the NIST database. Ingoring the electron masses is acceptable. The mass defect is closed related to nuclear binding energy. If we divide the above energy by 12 and times 931.5 MeV/amu, we obtain the bind energy per neucleio for 12C is 7.67 (see Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: Nuclear binding energy per nucleon (The image is from wiki) A complete table of nuclear bind energies can be found on Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (link). 1.5 High energy charged particles The energy of a moving particle (not a photon) depends on its velocity \\(\\upsilon\\) and its rest mass \\(m_0\\). \\[\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 = \\frac{m_0c^2}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\upsilon^2}{c^2}}}. \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] The energy can also be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} E = E_{0}+E_{K.E.}, \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] where E0 and EK.E. are the rest energy and kinetic energy (K.E.) of a particle. What is the velocity of an electron with a kinetic energy of 2 MeV? Using Eq. (1.1) and (1.2), 0.511 MeV + 2 MeV = 0.511 MeV/\\({\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\rightarrow v \\approx\\) 0.96 c. Similarly, you can find that to accelerate a proton to the velocity of 0.96 c, the kinetic energy will be about 2,400 MeV, i.e., you need give much more energy to accelerate protons to the speed close to the speed of light (proton machine is much larger). 1.6 High energy photons Wave-particle duality The energy of a photon particle is given by \\[\\begin{equation} E = h\\times v, \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] where h is the Planck constant (Physical constants), \\(v\\) is the frequency in unit of s-1 or Hertz. The energy can also be written in the form of electromagnetic waves \\[\\begin{equation} E\\ (eV) = \\frac{1,240}{\\lambda\\ (nm)}, \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] What are the wavelength and frequency of a 2 MeV photon? Using Eq. (1.3) and \\(v=\\frac{E}{h}=\\frac{(2\\times10^6\\ eV) \\cdot (1.6 \\times 10^{-19} J/eV)}{6.626\\times 10^{-34}J\\cdot s}\\) = \\(4.8 \\times 10^{20}\\) Hertz. Using Eq. (1.4), the wavelength of a 2 MeV photon is \\(\\frac{1240}{2\\times 10^{6}\\ eV} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\) nm. It is much samller than the size of an atom (0.1 nm) or that of DNA (2.5 nm). The size of a hydrogen nuclei is about 1.76 \\(\\times\\) 10-6 nm 1.7 Electron Shell Principle quantum number (\\(n = 1, 2, 3, ...\\) or K, L, M, …) – the main energy level (or shell) occupied by an electron. The energy can be calculated by\\[E_n=\\frac{Z^2{\\hbar}^2}{2m_0\\alpha^2_Bn^2},\\] where \\(\\alpha_B\\) is the Bohr radius (= 5.29 \\(\\times\\) 10-11 m). The K shell (binding) energy for Lead, Tungsten, and Carbon are 88 KeV, 69.5 KeV, and 0.28 KeV. Secondary quantum number (\\(l = s, p, d, ...\\)) – the energy sublevel (angular monentum) occupied by the electron. Magnetic quantum number (\\(m_l = -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l\\)) – the number of possible orientations (projections) for each of energy sublevels. Spin quantum number (\\(m_s=-1/2, 1/2\\)) – the two possible orientations that an electron can have in the presence of a magnetic field.

As long as you can count this large number accurately, the accuracy fo this type of atomic clock is about \\(10^{-10}\\) (\\(\\approx 1/9,192,631,770\\)).↩ Rutherford interpreted the results of the gold foil experiment or Geiger-Marsden experiment and established the Rutherford model of atom, which constitutes a tiny (\\(10^{-15}\\) m), heavy nucleus which consists of protons and/or neutrons. He also won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908 “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances”. He discovered three types of radiation: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and later \\(\\gamma\\) radiation.↩ In 1913, Bohr proposed a theory for the hydrogen atom based on quantum theory that (a) electrons orbit around the nucleus; (b) electrons orbits at a certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus without radiation and energy loss; (c) electrons can only gain and lose energy by jumping from one allowed orbit to another, absorbing or emitting electromagnetic radiation with a frequency: \\(v=\\frac{E_m-E_n}{h}\\). He won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1922.↩ Metastabe state is an excited state of an atom that has a longer lifetime than the ordinary excited states but generally has a shorter lifetime than the lowest, often stable, energy state, called the ground state. britannica↩ "],
["nut.html", "Chapter 2 Nuclear Transformation 2.1 Nuclear Decay (disintegration) 2.2 Activity", " Chapter 2 Nuclear Transformation Radioactivity was discoverred in 1986 by A.H. Becquerel when he wa 44 years old (Wiki). He received 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Maria and Pierre Curie. Radiation Sources (big picture) (Siebers 2009 AAPM talk) include Radioactive decay (Chapter 2) Alpha-decay Beta-decay (Section 24.4) Electron capture Isometric transitions Gamma-ray Atomic energy transitions Characteristic x-rays Auger electrons Accelerated charge particles Direct (electrons, protons) x-ray generators (synchrotron radiation (magnetic field), Bremmstrahlung) Interaction products (?) 2.1 Nuclear Decay (disintegration) General balance equations of radioactive decay \\[\\begin{equation} _Z^A P = ^{A-A_R}_{Z-Z_R}D + _{Z_R}^{A_R}R + \\sum Q, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where P and D stand for parent and daughter element, R for radiation, and Q is reaction energy (\\(\\sum Q = M_P-M_D-M_R\\)). To find out the Q-value, you can use a online Q-calculator. Atoms found in nature are either stable or unstable. An atom is unstable (radioactive) if these forces are unbalanced if the nucleus has an excess of internal energy EPA link. The instability of a radionuclide may result from an excess of either neutrons or protons. Radionuclides attempt to reach stability through ejecting neutrons and protons (Alpha-decay); converting one to the other with ejection of a beta particle or positron (Beta decay); the release of additional energy by photon emission (Gamma decay). 2.1.1 Alpha-decay Alpha-decay occurs in nuclides with atomic numbers above 82 (only the first 92 occur naturally) and where the ratio of neutrons to protons is low, thus resulting in the repulsive coulomb force of the protons overcoming the attractive strong nuclear force. \\[ _{88}^{226}Ra\\rightarrow _{86}^{222}Rn +_2^4\\alpha +\\gamma +Q \\] 2.1.2 Beta-decay Beta-decay, a neutron within the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron and an antineutrino are emitted, or a proton is converted into a neutron, and a positron and a neutrino are emitted. The forces responsible for the \\(\\beta\\)-decay are weak (referred to as weak nuclear force) compared with both the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force among the nucleons. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\begin{matrix} \\beta^-\\ \\text{decay}&amp; _{60}^{27}Co\\rightarrow _{27}^{60}Ni^{*} +\\beta^- + \\bar\\nu \\\\ \\beta^+\\ \\text{decay} &amp; _{9}^{18}F\\rightarrow _{8}^{18}O +\\beta^+ +\\nu + 1.022\\ \\text{MeV} \\end{matrix} \\end{matrix} \\] Neutrino (\\(\\nu\\)) and anti-neutrino (\\(\\bar \\nu\\)) results in spectrum of \\(\\beta\\) energies, and they are non-ionizing particles so we don’t consider them in dose calculation. The average energy of beta particles is about 1/3 of the maximum possible energy of \\(\\beta\\) particles (the same maximum possible energy of neutrinos). 2.1.3 Electron capture Electron capture (EC) is an alternative to positron decay. In this process, an electron, usually in the K shell, is captured within the nucleus and combined with a proton to create a neutron. Electron capture most often is followed by characteristic x-ray or Auger electron. Auger transition in 3 steps: the first electron is ejected creating a hole in the A level (e.g. K-shell), the second electron falls from the B (L shell) level to the A level, the third electron (the Auger electron) is ejected from the C level (could be L shell or other outer shells). The kinetic energy of the Auger electron will be EA - EB - EC. 2.1.4 Gamma decay Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy level. These \\(\\gamma\\)-rays are identical to the x-rays emitted by excited atoms, except that \\(\\gamma\\)-rays originate from within the nucleus and x-rays originate from outside the nucleus. The example is that Co-60 decays to Ni*-60 by emitting two \\(\\gamma\\)-rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV.The decay scheme can be found here. 2.2 Activity The activity (A) of a sample is the average number of disintegrations (decay) per second, \\[\\begin{equation} A = \\frac{\\Delta N}{\\Delta t} = \\lambda N, \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the The decay constant which is the probability that a nucleus will decay per second. Remember that Radioactive decay is a stochastic process. We can find certain laws only by observing a large number of events (decays here). From the equation above, we can obtain the radioative decay law at a certain time \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} N = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}, \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} A = A_0 e^{-\\lambda t}. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] The SI unit for radioactivity is Becquerel (Bq). The historic unit for radioactivity is Curie (Ci), and 1g of radium is 1 Ci. The relationship between Curie and Becquerrel is 1 Ci = 37 GBq or 1 GBq = 27 mCi More frequently, we use physical half-life or just half-life (\\(T_{1/2}\\)) instead of the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\). Their reqlationship is \\[\\begin{equation} T_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda}. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] For a Cs-137 source, how long does it decay to 98% of the original activity? Using Eq. (2.4) and (2.5), we get \\(A = A_0e^{-\\frac{ln2}{30}t} \\rightarrow 0.98 = e^{-\\frac{ln2}{30}t} \\rightarrow t =0.87\\ \\text{years}\\) It is easy to solve the above equation, but it will be faster to find a good estimation using the Taylor’s expansion with first two terms \\(e^{-\\frac{ln2}{30}t} \\approx 1-\\frac{0.693}{30}t\\). The caveat of using Taylor expansion is make sure the exponents are much smaller than 1. You can try this approach for question 3, but you will not get the correct answer. The yearly decay rate of Cs-137 is about 72/30 = 2.4% using the Rule Of 72 (i.e., you can double your invest using 72/a year rate of return (ROR), kind of reversed). The monthly and daily decay rate for Co-60 and Ir-192 is about 1.13% and 0.97%. For a Co-60 source, what is the activity in GBq of a sample containing 1016 atoms? Using Eq. (2.2) or (2.5) \\[\\begin{aligned} A &amp;= \\lambda N = \\frac{ln2}{T_{1/2}} N \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{0.693}{(5.3\\ yr) \\times (365 \\times 86,400\\ s/yr)} \\times 10^{16} atoms \\\\ &amp;= 4.1 \\times 10^7 atoms/s \\\\ &amp;= 0.041\\text{ GBq} \\end{aligned}\\] The average life is the (arithmetic) average lifetime for the decay of radioactive atomes. It relates to half-life by \\[\\begin{equation} T_{ave} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = 1.44T_{1/2}. \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] The remaining activity after a time interval equal to the average life is 37% (\\(A = A_0 e^{-\\lambda T_{ave}}\\)). The average or mean life is used to calculated the total decays: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Total num. of decays} = T_{ave}\\times A = 1.44T_{1/2}\\times A. \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] What is the total number of decays of 1 mCi Cs-137? Using (2.7), the number of decays is 1.44\\(\\times\\)(30 yr)\\(\\times\\)(3.15\\(\\times 10^7\\) s/yr)\\(\\times\\)(3.7\\(\\times10^7\\) decay/s) = 5.0\\(\\times 10^{16}\\). 2.2.1 Special activity We are going to use an example to explain how to calulate special acitivity. Continue on with the example above, what is the specific activity (SA) for that sample? We first need to find the sample mass which can be calculated by \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{mass} &amp;= \\frac{(10^{16}\\ atoms) \\times (59.9338\\ g/...)}{6.023\\times 10^{23}atoms/...} \\\\ &amp;= 9.95\\times 10^{-7}\\text{ g} \\end{aligned}\\] where … is called gram-atomic mass. The special activity is the ratio of activity to mass, and thus is equal to \\(4.2 \\times 10^4\\) GBq/g. Based on Example 2.2 and 2.4, the special actvity (SA) is inversely proportional to half-life and mass number (A) or SA \\(\\propto\\) (T1/2 A)-1 Solutions Q1 d) see the Sec. 2.2 Example 1.

["prox.html", "Chapter 3 Production of X-rays 3.1 History 3.2 Conventional x-ray tubes", " Chapter 3 Production of X-rays 3.1 History Cathod-ray tube (for example, Crookes tube)5. 1895-11-08, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-ray by observing fluorsece when applying high volotage (using an induction coil) on a board-covered Crookes tube (wiki and The Laureates: William Roentgen. Coolidge developed the hot cathode x-ray tube in 1913, in which a wire filament was heated with electrical current to release electrons by the process of thermionic emission. This was the first major breakthrough as cathod-ray tubes cannot generate reliable and high-intensity x-ray. The next major breakthrough in x-ray tube design was the rotating anode, which was developed by Albert Bouwers in 1930. Other minor improvements include metal ceramics (replacing glass), liquid bearing (replace ball bearing), and etc. Figure 3.1: First medical X-ray by Wilhelm Röntgen of his wife Anna Bertha Ludwig’s hand. (The image is from wiki) The Coolidge tube was the prototype for x-ray tubes in use today. 3.2 Conventional x-ray tubes The basic components of a useful x-ray tube include: (a) electron source (cathod), (b) high voltage supply, (c) target (anode) for x-ray production, (d) vacuum, and (e) collimator. Figure 3.2: X-ray tube components (From Rolf Behling’s talk at 2017 AAPM Spring Meeting.) 3.2.1 Electron Source (Cathode) Thermonic emission \\[\\begin{equation} J = \\text{const.} \\times T^2 \\times \\text{exp}(-e\\psi/kT) \\end{equation}\\] The filament is housed within a negatively charged focusing cup. With high voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are attracted to the target (anode) without electrons pile-up around the filement. In this scenerio, the tube is operated in the mode of filament-emission limited. With lower voltage applied across the tube, thermonic electrons are not pulled immediately to the target. The accumulated electrons (or space charge) will prevent additional electrons leaving the filament and therefor limit the tube current. Under this condition, the tube is operated in the mode of space-charge limited (e.g. mammography machine). Dual-focus x-ray tube 3.2.2 High voltage The electric potential difference (voltage) between the filament (cathode) and target (anode) of an x-ray tube affects the x-ray output, intensity (see electron source part) and spectrum of x-ray. State of art: high-frequency x-ray generators (1-100 kHz) - three-phase AC to almost DC What is kVp? It stands for maximum or peak volotage. Accodring to wiki, kVp controls the property called “radiographic contrast” of an x-ray image. The quantity mA\\(\\cdot\\)s is the primary controlling factor of radiographic density (# of photons), where mA is the tube current (the current generated in the electron beam) and s is the exposure time. Compared to the tube current (e.g. 1 mA in fluoroscopy to over 1,000 mA in angiography), the filament (supply) current is quite large (e.g. 5 A), depending on the efficiency of the thermionic emission. The x-ray output linearly propotional to \\((kV_p)^2\\cdot mA\\cdot s\\). The exposure is afffected by, in the order of largest to samllest, filament current, tube peak voltage, and tube current. 3.2.3 Target for x-ray production X-ray production is the result of Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation). The conversion efficiency from electrons to useful x-ray photons is only about 0.1%. This is maily due to low Bremsstrahlung efficiency \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Efficiency}\\approx 9 \\times 10^{-10} ZV, \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where Z is the atomic number of the target material and V is tube voltage. In addition, only a small portion (of all space (surface) of a sphere 4\\(\\pi r^2\\) 6) of x-ray is used (see Fig. 3.3). Most of high energy electrons will be wasted by generating heat in the target. Many design considerations are based on avoiding overheat such as rotating anode and the use tungsten material due to its high melting point of about 3,400 oC. Figure 3.3: The spatial distribution of x-ray generated around a thin target 3.2.4 Target X-ray spectra The x-ray spectrum shows characteristic x-rays7 superimposed with the continuous distribution of energies for the bremsstrahlung photons, with low energy part removed by x-ray tube enclosure.

I think this answer is wrong as this equaition is only valid for low energy electrons. You can see the reason by simply using 15 MeV instead of 6 MeV in the equation, and you will find efficiency is greater than 1! Q12: e) partially vaccum and low voltage; think about neon lighting; see wiki↩ A steradian is related to the surface area of a sphere in the same way a radian is related to the circumference of a circle (see https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/steradian.html). A new delivery technique called 4\\(\\pi\\) radiotherapy is proposed by Ke Sheng at UCLA https://shenglab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/interests.↩ Characteristic x-rays in x-ray tube is released as follows: (1) a high energy electron ejects K shell electron; (2) a L or M shell electron jumps to the empty K shell; (3) a photon is emitted with energy of EK-EL (\\(K_\\alpha\\); \\(\\alpha\\) means nearby transition) or EK-EM (\\(K_\\beta\\)). Characteristic x-rays can also be produced following a photoelectric photon interaction (incident photon ejects electron rather than incident electron)↩ "],
["gene.html", "Chapter 4 Clinical Treatment Generators 4.1 History 4.2 Components 4.3 Penumbra", " Chapter 4 Clinical Treatment Generators This chapter will be focused on microwave electron linear accelerator (linac). Other machines are or were also widely used for clinical treatmenet, including Cyclotron (E.O. Lawrence 1932), Betatron (D.O. Kerst 1940), Cobalt machine, Gamma Knife (Lars Leksell 1968), and etc. 4.1 History The developement of linac can be seen in figure below. Figure 4.1: History of linac design. 4.2 Components The principles of how a linac works are: Electrons are emitted from an electron gun (Sec. 4.2.1) from a hot cathode, are accelerated by pulsed kilovoltage (~ 50 keV), pass through a hole in an anode, and enter an acclerating waveguide. Electrons ride microwave down an accelerating waveguide (Sec. 4.2.3), to which high power microwave is fed from a microwave amplifier (Sec. 4.2.2), a magnetron or a klystron. High energy electrons leaves the waveguide and pass through bending magnet (Sec. 4.2.4) assembly to become more focused and near mono-energetic. The major componenets of a linac can be seen in figure below. Figure 4.2: a simple schematic of a linear accelerator 4.2.1 Electron gun Varian and Elekta have their own design for electron gun: Triode and diode. Figure 4.3: Varian (left) and Elekta (right) electron gun. The snapshot images are taken from here and Lamp adn tube museum. 4.2.2 Microwave amplifier VELOCITY MODULATION + RESONANCE The microwave is one type of electromagnetic waves with frequncy ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz and wavelength from 1 m to 1 mm. Figure 4.4: Electromagnetic specturm (the image is download from here). Microwave frequency in most medical linear accelerators is about 3 GHz (2,856 MHz in exact), which falls into the category of IEEE S-band (2-4 GHz, Wiki). The Mobetron and Cyberknife machines use higher frequency (8-12 GHz, categorized as in IEEE X band, for compact design (Hanna 1999 Applications of X-band Technology in medical accelerators). 4.2.2.1 Klystron The possibly best simple explanation about how a klystron amplifier and microwave oscillators work can be found on YouTube. A Klystron is a microwave amplifier tube that makes use of two (or more for better bunching result) resonant cavities. For a simple two cavity Klystron, The first resonance cavity is energized by very low-power microwaves through a coaxial cable. The microwave will cause alternating “E” fields across the gap between left and right cavity wall. As the electrons from the accelerated through the first cavity, half of them will be decelerated and the other help will accelerate (velocity modulation), and thus form electron bunches as they drift towards the second cavity. The Catcher cavity is resonant at the arrival frequency of the bunch. This will generates a retarding “E” field for slowing down electrons and in turn the electrons give their energies in the form of high-power microwaves (more electrons in a bunch \\(\\rightarrow\\) more kinetic energy \\(\\rightarrow\\) more EM energies induced in the 2nd resonant cavity). Figure 4.5: how a klystron works 4.2.2.2 Magnetron A Magnetron is a device that produces and amplifies microwave. The electrons emitted from the heated cathode are accelerated by the pulse electric field, EP, toward the anode across the evacuated drift space between cathode and anode. A static magnetic field, H, is applied perpendicular to the cross section of the device. The accelerated electrons induce an additional charge distribution shown on the anode poles and an electric field Em of microwave frequency between adjacent segments of the anode (similar to that in the catcher cavity of the klystron). Figure 4.6: how a magnetron works The comparison between a klystron and a magnetron can be seen in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Comparsion of a klystron and a magnetron Klystron Magnetron Construction Complicated Simple Power up to 7.5 MW up to 3 MW Efficiency ~55% lower efficiency lifetime 10,000 hours 5,000 hours Manufacture Varian Elekta 4.2.3 Waveguide Waveguides are evacuated or gas filled metallic structures of rectangular or circular cross-section used in transmission of microwaves. Two types of waveguide: RF power transmission waveguides (gas filled, sulfur hexafluoride SF6) for transmission of the RF power from the power source (Magnetron or Klystron) to the accelerating waveguide. Accelerating waveguides (evacuated to about 10-6 torr 1 torr ~ 1 mmHg) for acceleration of electrons Travelling Standing 4.2.4 Bending magnet Because velocities (energies) of electrons exiting the accelerating waveguide are not the same, the bending magnet is used to make electrons more mono-energetic when it reaches the (photon) target or (electron) scattering foil. Figure 4.7: Varian (upper) and Elekta (lower) design of bending magnet.

Figure 4.8: Components of modulator. 4.3 Penumbra The term penumbra means the region, at the edge of a radiation beam, over which the dose (rate) changes (80% to 20% - relative to c.a.x. dose) rapidly as function of lateral distance. The overall penumbra was contributed from three sources: Geometric penumbra is caused by the source (or focal spot) having a finite size and the location of the collimator. It can be reduced by decreasing the focal spot and move the collimator closer to the patient (e.g. Varian tertiary MLC). Transmission penumbra is caused by photons transmitted through the edge of the collimator. It can be reduced by aligning the collimator following the beam divergence (e.g. X and Y photon jaws). Physical (total) penumbra is the combination of transmission, geometric penumbra, and lateral scatter of radiation (photon and electrons) within the patient. Lateral electron disequilibrium (# of electrons projected laterally outward is not equal to # of electrons projected laterally inward). Because the range of these laterally projected electrons increases as energy increases, higher energy beams have a slightly greater penumbra than low energy beams.

Excerpt from Niroomand-Rad: In a Siemens machine, the electron beams pass through dual scattering foils. The first (primary) foil, made of stainless steel, serves to scatter the electron beam. Its thickness is 0.075 mm for 5-7 MeV beam and 0.030 mm for 10 MeV beams. The second (secondary) foil, made of 0.8 mm thick aluminum, for all the electron beams, produces a homogeneous radiation mainly by absorption. Collimation cones (typically multi-leveled to block electron spread at different distance) Jaws set at a much larger size than the cone sizes 14.5 Beam quality PDD Surface dose (70%-90%) R90 (therapeutic range ~ E/4) is the depth for tumor edge R10 - R90 for estimating dose fall-off to spare oARs Rp (practical range ~ E/2) - where beam stops x-ray contamination (from linac and phantom and patient, about 50% each) With energy, field size, and SSD increase, PDD will increase, decreases, and stays roughly the same.

For electrons in the range of 1-25 MeV, the range of the backscattered electrons is about 1-2 g/cm2 of polystyrene (see TG-70 table IV below). Example 3.1 A buccal mucosa lesion is treated with a 9 MeV electron beam incident externally on the cheek. Assuming cheek thickness including the lesion, to be 2 cm, calculate (1) the thickness of lead required to shield oral structures beyond the cheek; (2) magnitude of electron backscatter, and (3) thickness of bolus or aluminum to absorb backscattered electrons. (1) Electron energy at depth z, \\(E_z = E_0(1 - z/R_p)\\) ~ 5 MeV, lead thickness is 5/2 = 2.5 mm. (2) For the polystyrene-lead interface, the electron backscatter factor (EBF) can be calculated as , and thus EBF = 1.57 or 57% backscattering. 14.7 Total skin electron irradiation (TSEI) The total skin irradiation (TSI) is one of the most efficient techniques in the treatment of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). (Diamantopoulos) Its purpose is to deliver the prescribed dose (average 36 Gy over 18 fractions) to patient skin, without damaging any healthy organ. The main prerequisite for TSE installation is a linear accelerator capable of producing large (200 cm x 80 cm) and uniform fields (acceptable variation of dose distribution: ± 8% vertically and ± 4% horizontally within the central 160 cm x 60 cm field area according to AAPM TG-30) of relatively low energy electrons (4-10 MeV at the exit window, 3-7 MeV at patient’s surface) at an extensive SSD. Our institutional experience Treatment: Dose rate: 2500 MU/min (Truebeam High Dose Electron) or 900 MU/min (Artiste) Energy: 6 MeV technique: large-field technique - 6 patient positions, and two gantry angles per position Schedule: 6 beam per day; wear paper short Protection: Finger and toe nail shields Internal eye shields TG-51 was performed on this beam, with the machine output adjusted to 1cGy/MU at the depth of 1.3 cm deep (dmax) with 100 cm SSD with a 15 x 15 cm2 cone. The TG-51 setup was replaced with solid water and a PTW 23343 Markus chamber. A transfer factor was established for this chamber, 0.019675 nC/cGy. The gantry was then angled to 270° and the chamber placed a varying extended distances from the isocenter. At 330 cm SSD an acceptable dose rate was found, 59 cGy/min, without reducing field size and uniformity. Film was placed on the back side of the scatter screen at 330 cm SSD. The film was irradiated with 450 MU, with varying sets of beam angles. A ±10% uniformity was achieved using beam angles of 253° and 287°, over a height of 200 cm (figure 1). The patient treatment will then be 12 beams. The patient will be treated by the two gantry angles at each of 6 positions, 3 one day, 3 the next, per fraction. The patient will face the accelerator (AP beams) and be irradiated by 253° and 287° gantry angle beams. The patient will then rotate 120° (RPO), receive the two beams again, then rotate 120° (LPO) for the last two beams. The next day the patient will face away from the accelerator (PA), then rotate 120° (LAO), and again (RAO). A 1 cm thick scatter screen will be placed at 310 cm SSD. A cylindrical phantom, 30 cm in diameter was then placed at 330 cm SSD, centered with the lasers, with the scatter screen 20 cm in front of it. Powder Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD)s were placed around the circumference of the cylinder. Additional TLDs were placed around the circumference under 5mm of wax bolus. This phantom was irradiated with the two beams, (gantry angles of 253° &amp; 287°), and then rotated 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300° about its vertical axis, irradiated at each position with the two beams. This simulates the patient treatment. Each beam was 450 MU, 6MeV at 900 MU/min, with a 33x33cm field size. The average TLD reading was 67.6 with a standard deviation of 2.8 cGy. This gives the beam calibration factor of 67.6 cGy/450 MU per beam. The TLD value was compared to the chamber measurement from the two beams, but no phantom rotation. This is 26.2 cGy/450 MU. This implies B factor of 2.58 (expect 2.5-3). The B factor represents the increase in dose due to the overlapping of the surface exposed at each phantom rotation and the oblique angle of incidence. The Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) was determined using film (figure 2), chamber (figure 3) and TLD measurements. The chamber measurements are only based on directly incident beams, ie the phantom is not rotated. They give a PDD at 5 mm of around 93%. The film and TLD measurement used all 12 beams (6 phantom positions, 2 beams per position), therefore the surface dose is greatly increased by the oblique angles of incidence of the electron beams. This reduces the PDD. The film and TLDs both see a PDD of 85% at 5 mm. PDD at 5 mm is 85%. Calibration factor: 67.6 cGy / 450 MU MU = dose per fraction / (PDD * Calibration Factor) = 200 / (0.85 * 67.6/450 ) = 1566 Patient treated on TSET stand. 1 cm thick plastic scatter plate 20 cm in front of patient. 3 cm thick plastic shield for lower half of body 3 mm thick lead shields on fingernails and eyes Stand against wall* (how you make sure SAD and SSD setup?)

Physicsits and physicians together developed the field. There has not been a period since the beginning that has not witnessed innovations and progress in brachytherapy — B.R. Thomadsen in “Anniversary paper: past and current issues in brachytherapy physics” Why Brachytherapy is important? Brachytherapy is part of the starndard of care Better local control rates for certain disease site than using external beam technique Brachytherapy was the original intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) - Technical basis of radiation therapy 15.1 Important things to know Dose rates defined in ICRU 38 (1985) and NRC 10 CFR part 35 Ultralow dose rate: 0.01-0.3 Gy/hr (prostate implants) Low dose rate: 0.4-2.0 Gy/hr Medium dose rate: 2-12 Gy/hr High dose rate: &gt;12 Gy/h; modern HDR can deliver about 420 Gy/hr or 7 Gy/min Pulsed dose rate In Brachytherapy, sealed radioactive sources are placed in close proximity to a treatment target volume, either by directly inserting them into the tumor (e.g. prostate seed implants), or by loading them into devices that were previously inserted into or near the tumor (afterloading). Depending on placement of sources, the commonly used brachytherapy can be categoried as: Plaques or mold - eye plaques Interstitial - prostate implants Intracaitary - HDR cylinder Intraluminal - Bile duct, esophagus, IVBT 15.2 Isotopes 15.2.1 Radium sources Radiumsources used for implant therapy contain Ra-226 in secular equilibrium (takes about 1 month, see Section 2.1) with its decay products (stable Pb-206).14 The exposure rate from a 1 mCi point source of 226Ra that is in secular equilibrium with its decay products and enclosed within a 0.5 mmPt-Ir wall is 8.25 R/hr at a distance of 1 cm. The value of 8.25 R\\(\\cdot\\)cm2/hr\\(\\cdot\\)mCi is referred to as the exposure rate constant. The average energy is about 0.7-0.8 MeV, raning from less than 50 keV to 2.5 MeV. In shielding design, we need to consider the existence of high energy gamma rays although their contribution is small. The thus HVL(TVL) for Ra-226 is 1.66 cm (5.5 cm) (NRC link), which is greater than that for Co-60 (E{mean} = 1.25 MeV) 15.2.2 Radium substitutes Table 15.1: Frequently used radioactive isotopes15 Isotope \\(T_{1/2}\\) (days) Median E (KeV) HVL (mm lead) usage Cs-137 30 years 660 5.5 - Ir-192 74 400 2.5 interstitial implantation (in ribbon) I-125 60 28 0.025 prostate implants (24), eye plaques Pd-103 17 22 0.01 prostate implants (24) Cs-131 10 29 - intracavitary BT of uterine cervix Au-198 2.5 400 2.5 eye plaque Y90 (\\(\\beta\\) emitter) 2.67 937 - liver radioembolism 15.3 Source strength The progression of specification of source strength Radium sources has been specified in terms of mass of radium Cesium sources was specified in terms of milligram equivalents of radium (mg\\(\\cdot\\)Ra\\(\\cdot\\)eq) Sources can also be specified in terms of activity; apparent activity, of a source is determined from a measurement of the exposure rate at a distance; it describes the activity of that nuclide that would produce the same exposure rate when unencapsulated. AAPM recommends air-kerma strength. 15.3.1 Unit: Air-kerma strength \\(S_k\\) Air-kerma strength (Sk) of brachytherapy sources is defined as the air-kerma rate (\\(\\dot{K}_{\\delta}\\)) at a reference distance (e.g. 1 m) from the source center along the perpendicular bisector. The air-kerma strength is related to the quantity exposure rate by16 \\[\\begin{equation} S_k =\\dot K_\\delta \\cdot d^2 = \\dot X(d) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\bar W}{e}\\right) \\cdot d^2, \\tag{15.1} \\end{equation}\\] The SI unit of air-kerma strength Gy m2 s-1 or \\(\\mu\\)Gy m2 h-1. The exposure rate \\(\\dot X(d)\\) is measured using an ion chamber, a “reentrant”-type well chamber, or a dose calibrator supplied with a suitable standard source. The term \\(({\\bar W}/e )\\) is the averagy energy to create an ion pair (0.876 cGy/R). The international community uses the term of reference air-kerma rate (RAKR), which is defined as the air kerma rate at 1 m from the source in \\(\\mu\\)Gyh{-1} 15.4 Radiation dose from brachytherpay sources 15.4.1 From exposure rate Early prescriptions for brachytherapy treatments were expressed in terms of radiation exposure. The exposure rate (in R/hr) at some distance, r (cm), from a point source of radioactive material is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot X = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\delta}A}{r^2} \\tag{15.2} \\end{equation}\\] where A is the activity of the source, and \\(\\Gamma_{\\delta}\\) is the exposure rate constant for the nuclide. For example, \\(\\Gamma_{\\delta}\\) is 3.28, 4.62, 1.45, and 1.48 R\\(\\cdot\\)cm2/hr\\(\\cdot\\)mCi for 137Cs, 192Ir, 125I, and 103Pd, respectively. The resulting Sievert integral is shown \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r, \\theta) = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\delta}Af}{lr}\\int^{\\theta_2}_{\\theta_1}e^{-\\mu t/cos{\\theta}}d\\theta \\end{equation}\\] where f is the \\(f\\) factor (exposure to dose conversion), \\(l\\) is the length of source. Although the effects of photon scatter and attenuation in tissue are neglected, dose calculations can be reasonably accurate because contributions of scattered radiation to a point very nearly compensate for the tissue attenuation of radiation reaching the same point. 15.4.2 TG-43 Most brachytherapy dose calculations are now based on TG-43 and its updates17 and are done using computer programs. It should be noted that most current dose calculation still assumes that all material is water equivalent. The four principal factors influencing the relative dose distribution include: 1) Distance - a factor of 100 between the distances of 0.5 and 5 cm while the remaining factors over the same distance range rarely exceeds a factor of 2 or 3; 2) Attenuation and scattering in source structure - the dose near the longitudinal axis is usually smaller than on the transverse axis; 3) Attenuation by surrounding medium - compton scattering and photoelectric absorption; 4) Accumulation of scattering in surrounding medium. Although the manual calculation is not needed, it is helpful to understand how the dose distributions are calculated in TG-43. In TG-43, the dose rate distribution around a sealed brachytherapy source can be determined in two-dimensions (2D) using the following equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r, \\theta) = \\Lambda S_k \\frac{G_L(r, \\theta)}{G_L(r=1cm,\\theta=90^o)} g_L(r, \\theta) F(r,\\theta), \\tag{15.3} \\end{equation}\\] or a simplified 1D version \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot D(r) = \\Lambda S_k \\frac{1}{r^2} G_p(r)\\phi_{an}(r), \\tag{15.4} \\end{equation}\\] where r denotes the distance (cm) from the center of the active source to the point of interest and \\(\\theta\\) is the point of interest relative to the source longitudinal axis. Figure 15.1: TG-43 dose calculation Dose rate constant The dose-rate constant is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Lambda = \\frac{\\dot D(r_0, \\theta_0)}{S_k}. \\tag{15.5} \\end{equation}\\] It can be thought as the dose rate in water at a reference point (\\(r_0\\) = 1 cm for photon sources and 2 mm for beta emitters) along the transverse axis (\\(\\theta = 90^{\\circ }\\)) for source strength of 1 U. Radial dose function and geometry function The radial dose function g(r) represents the attenuation of radiation in tissue, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} g(r) = \\frac{\\dot D(r,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r_0,90^{\\circ})}{\\dot D(r_0,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r, 90^{\\circ})}. \\end{equation}\\] where \\(G(r,\\theta)\\) is the geometry function which accounts for the effect of the distribution of radioactive material inside the source on the dose distribution at a given point. It is equal to \\(1/r^2\\) for point source approximation, \\(\\frac{tan^{-1}[(x+L/2)/y]-tan^{-1}[(x-L/2)/y]}{Ly}\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{x^2-(L/2)^2}\\) for linear source approximation with \\(\\theta \\neq 0^{\\circ}\\) or \\(\\theta = 0^{\\circ}\\) and \\(x&gt;L/2\\). Anisotrpic function \\(F(r,\\theta)\\) is the anisotropy function, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} F(r,\\theta) = \\frac{\\dot D(r,\\theta)\\cdot G(r,90^{\\circ})}{\\dot D(r,90^{\\circ})\\cdot G(r, \\theta)}. \\end{equation}\\] It accounts for anisotropy of dose distribution around the source, including effects of absorption and scatter in medium, i.e., self-filtration in source, oblique filtration in walls, scattering and absorption in tissue. In TG-43U, typically calculated from Monte Carlo. The example information about Elekta Flexisource can be seen in the figure below 15.5 Biological Doses In brachytherapy there is a rapid falloff in dose as distance from the source increases due to inverse square law. The dose within the tumor may much different from the prescription dose, thus the concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was introduced by Dale et al. (1997). Mathematically, the generalized EUD is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} EUD= \\left( \\sum \\nu_iD^a_i \\right ) ^{1/a} \\end{equation}\\] Here \\(\\nu_i\\) is the fractional organ volume receiving a dose \\(D_i\\) and a is a tissue-specific parameter that describes the volume effect. \\(a \\rightarrow -\\infty\\), EUD = minimum dose; \\(a \\rightarrow -\\infty\\), EUD = maximum dose (serial organs); a = 1, EUD = mean dose; a = 2, EUD = RMS dose. The EUD model is parameterized by the single biological parameter a, which should be chosen so that the EUD reflects the intended biological properties for the given tumor or organ. Parameter a and the Lyman model parameter n are related by a = 1/n Tumor: a is a negative number (e.g., a = -15) Normal tissues: a is a positive number The volume-effect: very small normal tissue volumes (e.g. 1-2 cm3) can tolerate very high doses that larger volumes would not tolerate. There are a few exceptions to this such as spinal cord, though the dose as high as 167.3 Gy to the cord has been reported in very low dose rate brachytherapy of paraspinal tumor. Rogers et al. (2002) reported that the mean cord dose was 72.5 Gy (ranging: 53.1-167.3 Gy), combining the EBRT and I-125 brachytherapy. Radiation safety of brachytherapy sources Storage - shielding container; forceps, personal dosimetry Test for tumor distribution of activity - autoradiography using films (exposure distribution + source physicial position and shape) Evaluation the safety - leak test (the source is swapped with a moistened cotton swab, which is then placed into a scintellation counter). If you discover leaking seeds upon receiving them, you should contact the manufactor and your regulator (RSO?) and follow their guidance. 15.6 Solutions Q1 d) Q2 Shielding b) Q3 a) b) c) Q4 a) Q5 a) Q6 Initial dose rate c) Q7 b) Q8 The Paterson-Parker system c) Q9 The Quimby system a) Q10 The Paris system c) d) As \\(D = \\dot D\\times\\Delta t\\), \\(\\frac{\\Delta t_{new}}{\\Delta t_{old}}=\\frac{\\dot D_{old}}{\\dot D_{new}} = \\frac{A_{old}}{A_{new}} = \\frac{A_0e^{-10/30}}{A_0} = 0.79\\) Although the average energy of 60Co is higher than that of 226Ra, there are gamma rays of 1.76 and 2.2 MeV emitted from 226Ra sources. In shielding design, we need to consider their existence (although their contribution is small) and thus HVL for 226Ra is greater than HVL for 60Co.18 A 137Cs source is normally used for consistence check (like linac monthly QA) but not calibration.

Normally, we don’t send sources to NIST or ADCL, but instead a well chamber with specific inserts designed for different isotopes. To calibrate Bard PS-1251L I-125 sources, for instance, the well chamber with an I-125 insert will be used, which was checked using Bard PS-1251L I-125 sources at NIST or ADLC. TG-40 all long half-life sources should be calibrated; at least 10% or 2 ribbons (whichever is larger) should be calibrated for a large number of loose seeds with short half-life. If the institution’s verification of source strength disagrees with the manufacturer’s data by more than 3%, the source of the disagreement should be investigated. We further recommend that an unresolved disparity exceeding 5% should be reported to the manufacturer. Radioactive materials must be under control by the facility at all times. This means under direct control or by securing in a locked area. 15.8 TG-167 Table 15.2 lists isotopes and applications implemented at your center (see AAPM report [@nath_guidelines_2016] and talk by Rivard.

The small crystals of radium salt and filler were contained within cylindrical cells about 1 cm long. The cells were made of gold foil 0.1 to 0.2 mm thick and were sealed to prevent the escape of radon gas. Each source of radium contained 1 to 3 cells surrounded by a wall of platinum, reinforced with iridium (10%). The thickness (usually 0.5 or 1 mm) of the platinum-iridium wall was sufficient to absorb \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) radiation from the source.

The SI unit of effective dose and equivalent dose is Sievert (Sv). Because 1 Sv, equal to 1 Gy numerically, is rather large quantity, the milliSievert (mSv) is commonly used in practice. The relationship between mSv and mrem is, 1 mSv = 100 mrem. 16.1 Regulatory agencies U.S. NRC Naturally occurring radioisotopes Reactor- and accelerator-produced radionuclides Documentation (RT-related): 10 CFR 35, Part 19, 20, and 35 States X-ray – generating machines (CT simulator and Linac) NRC regulated materials (agreement states19) FDA Manufacture and sale of machines and TPS’s (501K clearance) DOT Safe transport of radioactive materials 16.2 Sources of radiation exposure According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) report 160 (2009), the average annual radiation dose per person in the U.S. is about 6.2 mSv, in which medical imaging contributes about 50% (e.g. CT: 24%, NM: 12%, interventional fluoroscopy 7%, conventional radiography 5%). Naturally occurring sources of radiation include cosmic radiation (5%), radioactive minerals in the ground and in your body (5%), and terrestrial radiation emitted by naturally occurring materials such as uranium, thorium, and radon (37%) in earth. The pie chart of sources of radiation exposure from NCRP 160 can be found here. 16.3 Stochastic and deterministic event Although the severity of the stochastic effect is independent of the dose, the probability of having such effects is proportional to the dose without dose threshold. The examples of stochastic effects include radiation induced cancer and genetic mutation. Skin erythema, epilation (hair loss), lens opacification, and tissue necrosis are best described as non-stochastic or deterministic events. For deterministic effects, there is a threshold and the severity of the effect depends on the dose. To avoid unacceptable complications, normal tissue should be below a tolerance dose (TD) (Emami et al.) Complications is categorized as fatal, severe (e.g. grade 3-4 pneumonitis), and quality-of-life complications. TD5%/5 and TD50%/5 are used to imply complications in 5 years. 16.3.1 TDS rule Time (\\(D \\propto \\dot{D}\\times \\Delta t\\)), distance (inverse square law), and shield (attenuation) measures are major factors in consideration of minimizing the unavoidable radiation exposure. Other procedures to minimize the exposure are containment and NRC’s system for radiation protection according to NRC guidelines. The NRC’s system for protection includes (1) dose limits for radiation workers and members of the public; (2) monitoring and labeling radioactive materials; (3) posting signs in and around radiation areas; and (4) reporting the theft or loss of radioactive material. In addition, the NRC imposes penalties for failures to follow the agency’s regulations. If the licensees’ can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States. 16.3.2 ALARA 16.4 Shielding Calculation Shielding design goal, workload, use factor, occupancy factor. 16.4.1 Design goal This design goal for an uncontrolled area is 0.02 mSv/week (about 1 mSv annually for frequent or continuous exposure) or for a controlled area is 0.1 mSv/week (about 5 mSv annually – this is lower than the recommended value of 50 mSv but is based upon the ALARA principle). The primary barrier is designed and constructed to attenuation useful high energy and high dose rate beams. The most commonly used detector is a large-volume pressurized ionization chamber survey meter. Although a GM counter may be used to quickly detect shielding issue, it can’t measure radiation of high dose rates due to the “dead time” of the tub. In addition, the GM counter cannot distinguish the energy (e.g. 6 MV and 15 MV) of the incident radiation.20 16.4.2 Workload 16.4.3 Use factor 16.4.4 Occupancy factor \\[\\begin{equation} B_{pri}=\\frac{P_{pri}d_{pri}^2}{WUT} \\end{equation}\\] P: shielding design goal (controlled area: 0.1 mSv/week and uncontrolled area: 0.02 mS/week); unit: mSv/week dpri: distance from the target to the point of protection; no unit W: workload (dose) at the isocenter; unit: [mSv/week] U: use factor; T: occupancy factor \\[\\begin{equation} B_L=\\frac{P_Ld_L^2}{0.001\\cdot WT} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} B_{sca}=\\frac{P_{sca}}{\\alpha WT}d_{sca}^2d_{sec}^2\\frac{400}{F} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 16.1: THe first and equivalent tenth-value layer for concrete, steel, and lead. The radiation safety committee is required by the USNRC for institutions under a type-A specific license of broad scope (10. CFR part 33.11) as a means for managerial control over licensed activities. The committee shall consist of a radiation safety officer (RSO), an authorized user, a representative of management who is neither the RSO nor an authorized user, and a nurse. There are also Type B and C specific license of broad scope for licensees in using one and/or two isotopes and limited quantities. 2017 AAPM Annual Meeting Strategies for Quality Improvement Based On RO-ILS Information 16.5 Survey A radiation survey is required after linacs are installed in the vault. Typically, a Geiger-Müller (GM) counter, a large-volume pressurized ion chamber, and a BF3 proportional counter (if high energy photons are installed) are used to perform this task. 16.5.1 Detectors A GM counter is used to detect the presence of radiation, which consists of a tube filled with lower pressure (~ 0.1 atmosphere) inert gas (98% helium and 1.3% butane. For radiation survey, it is used to detect potentially unexpected large exposure due to deviation of construction from the planned schematic. In contrast to measuring average current produced over many interactions as in an ion chamber, the reading is recorded for each individual interaction in a GM detector. Therefore, a GM counter suffers its inability (due to “dead time”21 of the tube) to measure high exposure rate from a linac even behind barriers. In addition, a GM counter cannot distinguish the energy (e.g. 6 MV and 15 MV) of the incident radiation. A GM counter A large volume pressurized ion chamber survey meter is used to quantify the exposure behind barriers. A BF3 proportional counter is most commonly used for neutron detection. A BF3 counter is an active monitoring (passive monitoring: bubble detectors, TLDs) device that uses Boron to capture neutrons. If the licensees can limit the radiation to 1 mSv to the public and 50 mSv to adult radiation works in a year, the NRC may enter into an agreement with a State governor to give the State authority for regulating radioactive materials. States that meet these conditions and agree to regulate materials using the same standards as the NRC are called Agreement States.↩ A farmer-type ionization chamber is most commonly used for linac output measurements. It is not suitable for survey measurement due to its small detection volume, ~0.6cc. A scintillation detector is designed (a scintillator plus a photo-multiplier) to detect small signals. For example, a liquid scintillation counter is used to detect removable I-125 contamination on swabs. A BF3 proportional counter is most commonly used for neutron detection. More information can be found on IAEA presentation.↩ The “dead time” is the time it takes for the GM detector to “reset” (for the readout circuit). During this reset process, the GM counter does not “measure” any radiation.↩ "],

The MUs of an IMRT plan largely depend on the degree of dose modulation within a target and/or a proximity between a target and nearby OARs.

Linac performance for small MU delivery Leaf positional accuracy Inter- and intra-leaf leakage Tough-and-groove effect Leaf speed accuracy Solution: e Generally speaking, the MLC delivery can be categorized into two types: static (e.g., step-and-shoot) and dynamic (e.g., vmat and conformal-arc). Linac performance on small MU delivery has been a serious issue for static MLC delivery. Xia et al. (2002) has used a simple formula to relate the dose error (\\(\\Delta\\)) with dose rate (R), communication time (T), and MU/segment (M): \\(\\Delta =RT/M\\) For example, if dose rate is 600 MU/min, T = 100 mS, and M = 1 MU/seg, the dose error 1 or 100%. Therefore, larger dose errors are expected for smaller MU segments with certain dose rate and communication time. Recent progress in increase of sampling rate (e.g., from 100 ms to 20 ms) and integration of MLC controller with the linac have significantly improved the dose delivery accuracy for step-and-shoot IMRT Li et al. (2012). In addition, as the optimization algorithms improved, the use of increased minimal MU per segment (&gt; 4-8) further reduce the dose errors caused by smaller MU segments used in the plan. Leaf positioning error impact also 20.13 Q12 The contribution of MLC leakage to the total dose from an IMRT field: Is the largest contribution of the dose Increases with increase in leaf speed Increases with increase in leaf gap width May be neglected in the final dose calculation None of the above Solution: e More Inverse planning procedures Clinical objectives (goals) are specified first in terms of desired (physical or biological ) dose or DVH goals.

A 2013 PMB paper, Radiobiological effects of altering dose rate in filter-free photon beams, showed that altering radiotherapy dose rate through either changing pulse repetition frequency or instantaneous dose rate does not have an effect on cell survival. An increase in survival was seen in both modes upon protracting dose delivery to 15, 30 or 60 min rather than delivering acutely. Is this important to PLDR?

It consists of a rectagular base25 with four posts, which is attached to the patient’s skull using 4 pins. The front piece of the frame is removalbe and comes with either straight or curved design. The origin of the Leksell coordinate system is located outside the frame, and is superior, lateral, posterior to the patient on the patient’s right side. The coordinate system only uses positive numbers. The complete list of frame accessories can be found on the Elekta page. Here we are going to focus on GK Perfraction and Icon which are account for most GKs used in US. The application of G-frame in Perfraction is less critical than that in Model-C because of increased collimator space. 21.3.1.1 Frame cap The Frame Cap is plastic box attached to the frame to check whether there is conflict between the head, posts or pins and GK collimator. However, if a lesion is very posterior or very anterior, it may be necessary to measure lengths of the posts above and below the frame together with the length of bins. why? In general these measurements should be performed in all metastasis cases. This avoids difficulties if new eccentric metastases are discovered on the day of treatment. 21.3.1.2 CT or MR indicator The Leksell CT/MR/angio indicator is used with the frame for target localization.

During stereotactic localization, you identify the indicator marker on CT or MR axial scans. how does this process tell the system where is origin and where is the isocenter? As part of the imaging process, it is essential to provide exact points of reference by means of which the shape and position of the targets can be ascertained with respect to the patient’s skull.

The correction is done so that the delivery of the plan preserves the planned position of each individual isocenter (shot) in the patient anatomy according to the current patient position. The rigid transformation is based on the co-registration of the planning and the reconstructed CBCT images. It describes the translation and rotation of the patient and is used to accomplish the correction of each shot. The delivery characteristics, i.e. beam-on times and collimators, are otherwise identical to the plan. 21.5 GK Troubleshooting When doing CBCT verification, the Frame docking did not work.

The following radiophysical data is pre-stored in Gamma Plan: 4 beam profiles (OARs), one for each beam sizes measured at 400 mm distance from source center and at 80 mm depth in polystyrene. One data set to analytically calculate Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) 4 measured output factors, one for each beam size 21.7 Commissioning of GK The ion chamber is widely used for the measurement of the depth dose in conventional photon beams. The correction for the depth dose measurement depends on the ratio of the mass attenuation coefficient of the detector material and water, \\(\\left( \\mu/\\rho \\right )^{detector}_{water}\\). In another word, if the detector is near tissue (water) equivalent, i.e., near equivalent Z number, there is no necessity for depth correction. Although silicon diodes and radiographic films typically need corrections, the diamond diodes (unlike silicon diodes) and radiochromic films are both near tissue-equivalent. 21.8 Preparation of GK Treatment Planning 21.8.1 Frame Application: model C The Leksell frame runs from 40 mm to 160 mm in the X axis using the automatic positioning system (APS), runs from 25 mm to 175 mm in the Y axis, and the Z axis values are not marked on the frame but are calculated by the treatment planning software from fiducial markers. 21.8.2 Frame application: Perfexion With the Perfexion model a new instrument has been introduced called the frame cap.

The author questioned a few dosimetric studies in comparing several delivery systems, and stated that the questions of dosimetry needs to be answered, which include: the source of the photon radiation (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator); the nature of the collimators (fixed aperture, iris, micro-multileaf, etc.); moving or stationary radiation sources during beam-off time or beam-on time; the fixation of the head; the planning software; the imagery used; the way the images are acquired (dedicated protocols, head fixation, etc.); the number of beams; the number of arrival angles; the exit dose; the scatter factor of a given beam; the distance source to target; the time period over which a dose is delivered; the system’s overall accuracy; dose rates; the nature and the size of the lesion; the shape of the lesion; its proximity to organs at risk; the experience and the neurosurgical and anatomical knowhow of the radiosurgeon. The SRS treatments have been delivered using GK, CK, tomotherapy machines, and linacs (Lutz et al. (1987))26. To simulate the head frame used in the SRS, a body frame was used in early SBRT treatments (Sweden and Japan) in early 1990s. With advances of technologies, however, most current SBRT treatments do not use body frames , because the localization accuracy is comparable between frame-based and frameless SBRT and worse than that in the SRS.

The appranet activity of the new source is normally about 10 Ci. According to Eq. (15.1) and Eq.

MRI has been soft tissue contrast; MRI has better overlap with FPG-PET volumes. (?more clinical importance); Improved overall survivial for large tumours (&gt;5 cm), 28% versus 58% (p = 0.003), when the target is drawn on MRI.[@potter_clinical_2007] Idea: availability of commercial dummy sources for MRI is limited. What are the targets in MR-based HDR? Targets include gross tumor volume (diagnosis) (GTVD), gross tumor volume (brachy) (GTVB1, GTVB2, …), high risk CTV (HR CTVB1, HR CTVB2, …), and intermediate risk CTV (IR CTVB1, IR CTVB2, …). The IR CTV include the microscopic disease, IR CTV = HR CTV + 5-15 mm margin. The details about target delineation and dose can be found in the recommendations from GEC-ESTRO Working Group The choice of MR sequence is essential for optimal visualisation of the applicator (plastic or titanium):[@dimopoulos_recommendations_2012; @haack_applicator_2009] Plastic has weak signal on T2; use of markers Titanium has (induced) susceptibility artifact, and thus more distortions for higher magnetic strength; worse on T2; T1 is more suitable (? Why Titanium is MR compatible? ) If an applicator has been shown to be MR conditional for a 1.5T MRI, then it does not mean that it can be safely used in a 3T system without the need for further testing. CT still provides best imaging for applicator in terms of spatial accuracy (1 mm on CT vs. 1-2 mm on MRI for the localization of first dwell position) and artifacts. 23.4.2 Endometrial cancer Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in the United States.

["bed.html", "Chapter 30 Radiobiology 30.1 Introduction 30.2 BED", " Chapter 30 Radiobiology If we double the dose per fraction from 2 to 4 Gy (keeping total dose constant), the effect is 20% greater for tumors but 100% greater for late complications. Further, if a given physical dose is spread evenly over 24 h instead of 2 min, its effect is reduced by 20% for most tumors, but to about 1/2 for late complications. - Jack F. Folwer 30.1 Introduction BED: Biological EFFECTIVE Dose, proportional to log cell kill and thus more useful as a meaure of biological damage than physical dose. EQD: Biologicallly EQUIVALENT total Dose, usually in 2 Gy dose fractions. The total dose of a schedule in question gives the same log cell kill as the schedule in 2 Gy dose fractions. Any BED can be easily converted into its EQD by dividing the BED by the Relative Effectiveness: \\[\\begin{equation} RE = 1+\\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}, \\tag{30.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(d\\) is a dose per fraction, and \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\) is ratio of “intrinsic radiosensitivity” to “repair capability”&quot; of a specified tissue. 30.2 BED The phantom of immunological response keeps rearing its head, with little practical effect … Practical now? Radiation sterilizes cells, meaning that they do not die immediately, but at the time of the next cell division, or a few divisions later. Why? The BED can be calculated by: \\[\\begin{equation} BED = \\frac{E}{\\alpha} = nd\\left(1+\\frac{d}{\\alpha / \\beta}\\right) - \\frac{ln2}{\\alpha T_p}(T-T_k), \\tag{30.2} \\end{equation}\\] where E is log cell kill \\(\\alpha\\) is the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells, defined as how many lns are killed (sterilized) per Gy, in a non-repairable way. \\(\\beta\\) is the repairable portion of the radiation damage, requiring 6 hours or more for complete repair. T is the overall time Tk is the kick-off or onset time Tp is the average cell-number doubling time BED can be expressed as Gy3 (or Gy2) for late complications, or as Gy10 (or Gyx) for tumor or early normal-tissue reactions, the subscript referring to the \\(\\alpha/\\beta\\) of the relevant tissue used in its calculation. 30.2.1 Cell survival curve After radiation, the surviving proportion (S) can be written as \\[ lnS=-\\alpha d-\\beta d^2 \\] where D0 is the average dose that sterilize one cell. If we take \\(ln\\) on both sides, we have \\[\\begin{equation} lnS=-D/D_0. \\tag{30.3} \\end{equation}\\] This would be called “one-hit” curve. "]
