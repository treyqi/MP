## Patient-specific QA

At CC, we do PSQA using 2D ion-chamber array and EPID.

*Question: compared to film/chamber, what are the limitations of EPID-based QA?*

- not true composite (TC)?
- 

*What are the action limit and tolerance limit at CC?*

*For EPID-based QA, how do you make sure the physical properties (sag, position, ...) of imager are still in tolerance?* 

- `IsoCal` Calibration
