> If we double the dose per fraction from 2 to 4 Gy (keeping total dose constant), the effect is **20% greater** for tumors but **100% greater** for late complications. Further, if a given physical dose is spread evenly over 24 h instead of 2 min, its effect is **reduced by 20%** for most tumors, but to about **1/2** for late complications. - Jack F. Folwer

## Introduction

- <font color="Salmon">BED</font>: Biological **EFFECTIVE** Dose, proportional to log cell kill and thus more useful as a meaure of biological damage than physical dose.   
- <font color="Salmon">EQD</font>: Biologicallly **EQUIVALENT** total Dose, usually in 2 Gy dose fractions. The total dose of a schedule in question gives the same log cell kill as the schedule in 2 Gy dose fractions.

Any BED can be easily converted into its EQD by dividing the BED by the <font color="Salmon">Relative Effectiveness</font>:

\begin{equation}
    RE = 1+\frac{d}{\alpha/\beta},
    (\#eq:re)
\end{equation}

where $d$ is a dose per fraction, and $\alpha/\beta$ is ratio of "intrinsic radiosensitivity"
to "repair capability"" of a specified tissue.


## BED {#bed}

- The phantom of **immunological** response keeps rearing its head, with little practical effect ...  Practical now?
- Radiation sterilizes cells, meaning that they do not die immediately, but at the time of the next cell division, or a few divisions later. Why?

The BED can be calculated by:

\begin{equation}
    BED = \frac{E}{\alpha} = nd\left(1+\frac{d}{\alpha / \beta}\right) - \frac{ln2}{\alpha T_p}(T-T_k),
    (\#eq:bed)
\end{equation}

where

- E is log cell kill
- $\alpha$ is the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells, defined as how many lns are killed (sterilized) per Gy, in a *non-repairable* way.
- $\beta$ is the **repairable** portion of the radiation damage, requiring 6 hours or more for complete repair.
- T is the overall time
- T~k~ is the kick-off or onset time
- T~p~ is the average cell-number doubling time

BED can be expressed as Gy~3~ (or Gy~2~) for late complications, or as Gy~10~ (or Gy~x~) for tumor or early normal-tissue reactions, the subscript referring to the $\alpha/\beta$ of the relevant tissue used in its calculation.

### Cell survival curve

After radiation, the <font color="Salmon">surviving proportion</font> (S) can be written as

$$
lnS=-\alpha d-\beta d^2
$$
where D~0~ is the average dose that **sterilize** one cell. If we take $ln$ on both sides, we have
\begin{equation}
    lnS=-D/D_0.
    (\#eq:survival)
\end{equation}

This would be called "one-hit" curve.
