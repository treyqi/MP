**Why Brachytherapy is important?**

1. Brachytherapy is part of the starndard of care
2. Better local control rates for certain disease site than using external beam technique

## Isotopes

### Radium sources

Radiumsources used for implant therapy contain Ra-226 in secular equilibrium (takes about 1 month, see Section \@ref(decays)) with its decay products (stable Pb-206).[^radium] 

[^radium]:
The radium was supplied in the form of a salt, which was mixed with an inert filler such as magnesium oxide or barium sulfate. The small crystals of radium salt and filler were contained within cylindrical cells about 1 cm long. The cells were made of gold foil 0.1 to 0.2 mm thick and were sealed to prevent the escape of radon gas. Each source of radium contained 1 to 3 cells surrounded by a wall of platinum, reinforced with iridium (10%). The thickness (usually 0.5 or 1 mm) of the platinum-iridium wall was sufficient to absorb $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation from the source. Gamma rays were attenuated only slightly by the wall.

The exposure rate from a 1 mCi point source of ^226^Ra that is in secular equilibrium with its decay products and enclosed within a 0.5 mmPt-Ir wall is 8.25 R/hr at a distance of 1 cm. The value of **8.25 R$\cdot$cm^2^/hr$\cdot$mCi** is referred to as the <font color="Salmon">exposure rate constant</font>. The average energy is about 0.7-0.8 MeV, raning from less than 50 keV to 2.5 MeV. In shielding design, we need to consider the existence of high energy gamma rays although their contribution is small. The thus HVL(TVL) for Ra-226 is 1.66 cm (5.5 cm) (NRC [link](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1122/ML11229A721.pdf)), which is greater than that for Co-60 (E~{mean}~ = 1.25 MeV)

## Source strength

The progression of specification of source strength

- Radium sources has been specified in terms of <strike>mass</strike> of radium
- Cesium sources was specified in terms of <strike>milligram equivalents of radium</strike> (mg$\cdot$Ra$\cdot$eq)
- Sources can also be specified in terms of activity; <strike>apparent activity</strike>, of a source is determined from a measurement of the exposure rate at a distance; it describes the activity of that nuclide that would produce the same exposure rate when unencapsulated.
- AAPM recommends <font color="Salmon">air-kerma strength</font>.

### Unit: Air-kerma strength $S_k$ {#sk}

Air-kerma strength (S~k~) of brachytherapy sources is defined as the <font color="Salmon">air-kerma rate</font> ($\dot{K}_{\delta}$) at a reference distance (e.g. 1 m) from the source center along the perpendicular bisector. The air-kerma strength is related to the quantity exposure rate by[^sk_measurement]

\begin{equation}
  S_k =\dot K_\delta \cdot d^2 = \dot X(d) \cdot  \left( \frac{\bar W}{e}\right) \cdot d^2,
  (\#eq:sk)
\end{equation}

The SI unit of air-kerma strength Gy m^2^ s^-1^ or __$\mu$Gy m^2^ h^-1^__. The exposure rate $\dot X(d)$ is measured using an ion chamber, a "reentrant"-type well chamber, or a dose calibrator supplied with a suitable standard source. The term $({\bar W}/e )$ is the averagy energy to create an ion pair (**0.876 cGy/R**). 

The international community uses the term of <font color="Salmon">reference air-kerma rate</font>  (RAKR), which is defined as the air kerma rate at 1 m from the source in $\mu$Gyh^{-1}^

## Radiation dose from brachytherpay sources

### From exposure rate

Early prescriptions for brachytherapy treatments were expressed in terms of radiation exposure.  

The exposure rate (in R/hr) at some distance, r (cm), from a point source of radioactive material is:

\begin{equation}
   \dot X = \frac{\Gamma_{\delta}A}{r^2}
   (\#eq:exposure)
\end{equation}

where A is the activity of the source, and $\Gamma_{\delta}$ is the `exposure rate constant` for the nuclide. For example, $\Gamma_{\delta}$ is 3.28, 4.62, 1.45, and 1.48 R$\cdot$cm^2^/hr$\cdot$mCi for ^137^Cs, ^192^Ir, ^125^I, and ^103^Pd, respectively.

The resulting `Sievert integral` is shown 
\begin{equation}
   \dot D(r, \theta) = \frac{\Gamma_{\delta}Af}{lr}\int^{\theta_2}_{\theta_1}e^{-\mu t/cos{\theta}}d\theta
\end{equation}
where f is the $f$ factor (exposure to dose conversion), $l$ is the length of source. 

Although the effects of photon scatter and attenuation in tissue are neglected, dose calculations can be reasonably accurate because contributions of scattered radiation to a point very nearly compensate for the tissue attenuation of radiation reaching the same point.

### TG-43 {#tg43}

Most brachytherapy dose calculations are now based on TG-43 and its updates[^tg43-updates] and are done using computer programs. It should be noted that most current dose calculation still assumes that all material is **water equivalent**. 

The four principal factors influencing the relative dose distribution include: 1) **Distance** - a factor of 100 between the distances of 0.5 and 5 cm while the remaining factors over the same distance range rarely exceeds a factor of 2 or 3; 2) **Attenuation and scattering in source structure** - the dose near the longitudinal axis is usually smaller than on the transverse axis; 3) **Attenuation by surrounding medium** - compton scattering and photoelectric absorption; 4) **Accumulation of scattering in surrounding medium**. 

Although the manual calculation is not needed, it is helpful to understand how the dose distributions are calculated in TG-43. In TG-43, the dose rate distribution around a sealed brachytherapy source can be determined in two-dimensions (2D) using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
   \dot D(r, \theta) = \Lambda S_k \frac{G_L(r, \theta)}{G_L(r=1cm,\theta=90^o)} g_L(r, \theta) F(r,\theta),
   (\#eq:tg43)
\end{equation}
or a simplified 1D version
\begin{equation}
   \dot D(r) = \Lambda S_k \frac{1}{r^2} G_p(r)\phi_{an}(r),
   (\#eq:tg43-1D)
\end{equation}

where r denotes the distance (cm) from the center of the active source to the point of interest and $\theta$ is the point of interest relative to the source longitudinal axis.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tg-43, fig.align='center', out.width='70%',fig.cap= 'TG-43 dose calculation'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/tg43.jpg")
```


**Dose rate constant**

The `dose-rate constant` is defined as:
\begin{equation}
   \Lambda = \frac{\dot D(r_0, \theta_0)}{S_k}.
   (\#eq:dose-rate-constant)
\end{equation}

It can be thought as the dose rate in water at a reference point ($r_0$ = 1 cm for photon sources and 2 mm for beta emitters) along the transverse axis ($\theta = 90^{\circ }$) for source strength of 1 U. 

**Radial dose function and geometry function** 

The `radial dose function` g(r) represents the attenuation of radiation in tissue, defined as  
\begin{equation}
g(r) = \frac{\dot D(r,90^{\circ})\cdot G(r_0,90^{\circ})}{\dot D(r_0,90^{\circ})\cdot G(r, 90^{\circ})}.
\end{equation}
where $G(r,\theta)$ is the `geometry function` which accounts for the effect of the distribution of radioactive material inside the source on the dose distribution at a given point. It is equal to $1/r^2$ for point source approximation, $\frac{tan^{-1}[(x+L/2)/y]-tan^{-1}[(x-L/2)/y]}{Ly}$ or $\frac{1}{x^2-(L/2)^2}$ for linear source approximation with $\theta \neq 0^{\circ}$ or $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ and $x>L/2$.

**Anisotrpic function**

$F(r,\theta)$ is the `anisotropy function`, defined as
\begin{equation}
F(r,\theta) = \frac{\dot D(r,\theta)\cdot G(r,90^{\circ})}{\dot D(r,90^{\circ})\cdot G(r, \theta)}.
\end{equation}
It accounts for anisotropy of dose distribution around the source, including effects of absorption and scatter in medium, i.e., self-filtration in source, oblique filtration in walls, scattering and absorption in tissue. In TG-43U, typically calculated from Monte Carlo.

## Biological Doses

In brachytherapy there is a rapid falloff in dose as distance from the source increases due to inverse square law. The dose within the tumor may much different from the prescription dose, thus the concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was introduced by Dale et al. (1997). Mathematically, the generalized EUD is defined as 
\begin{equation}
EUD= \left( \sum \nu_iD^a_i \right ) ^{1/a}
\end{equation}

Here $\nu_i$ is the fractional organ volume receiving a dose $D_i$ and a is a tissue-specific parameter that describes the volume effect. 

- $a \rightarrow -\infty$, EUD = minimum dose; 
- $a \rightarrow -\infty$, EUD = maximum dose (serial organs); 
- a = 1, EUD = mean dose;
- a = 2, EUD = RMS dose.

The EUD model is parameterized by the single biological parameter a, which should be chosen so that the EUD reflects the intended biological properties for the given tumor or organ. Parameter a and the Lyman model parameter n are related by a = 1/n
	Tumor: a is a negative number (e.g., a = -15)
	Normal tissues: a is a positive number 

The volume-effect: very small normal tissue volumes (e.g. 1-2 cm3) can tolerate very high doses that larger volumes would not tolerate. There are a few exceptions to this such as spinal cord, though the dose as high as 167.3 Gy to the cord has been reported in very low dose rate brachytherapy of paraspinal tumor. Rogers et al. (2002) reported that the mean cord dose was 72.5 Gy (ranging: 53.1-167.3 Gy), combining the EBRT and I-125 brachytherapy. 

Radiation safety of brachytherapy sources

- Storage - shielding container; forceps, personal dosimetry
- Test for tumor distribution of activity -  `autoradiography` using films (exposure distribution + source physicial position and shape)
- Evaluation the safety - `leak test` (the source is swapped with a moistened cotton swab, which is then placed into a `scintellation` counter). If you discover leaking seeds upon receiving them, you should contact the manufactor and your regulator (RSO?) and follow their guidance.

Although the average energy of ^60^Co is higher than that of ^226^Ra, there are gamma rays of 1.76 and 2.2 MeV emitted from ^226^Ra sources. In shielding design, we need to consider their existence (although their contribution is small) and thus HVL for ^226^Ra is greater than HVL for ^60^Co.^[https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1122/ML11229A721.pdf]  

A ^137^Cs source is normally used for consistence check (like linac monthly QA) but not calibration.  

Like external beam radiotherapy, the inverse square law is always the biggest factor for dose calculation.  

Should c) and d) be correct?  
  

The prescription dose or total dose for an prostate implant is

\begin{equation*}
D = \int^{\infty}_0 \dot D_0 \cdot e^{-\frac{0.693}{T_{1/2}}t}dt
\end{equation*}

Using an important definite integral, $\int^{\infty}_0 e^{-ax} dx = \frac{1}{a}$, we can find that 

\begin{equation*}
D = \dot D_0 \cdot \frac{T_{1/2}}{0.693} \rightarrow \dot D_0 = \frac{D}{59.4/0.693}=\frac{14400 \text{ cGy} \times 0.693}{59.4 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day}} = \boxed{7.0\text{ cGy/hr}}
\end{equation*}



[^atten]:
Form the NIST table (https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/ComTab/water.html), the total attenuation coefficients in water are about 0.38, 0.1, and 0.09 cm^-1^ for the photon energies of 30 (I-125), 400 (Au-198 and Ir-192), and 600 KeV (Cs-137), respectively. A good reference can be found at https://aapm.org/meetings/amos2/pdf/42-11873-3201-79.pdf

[^sk_measurement]:
The equation above is a revised definition of air-kerma strength (new cutoff energy 5 keV); experimentally, an aluminum filter is put in front of [NIST wide angle free-air chamber (WAFAC)](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/calibration-low-energy-photon-brachytherapy-sources) to get rid of photons with lower energies. 

[^tg43-updates]:
Other TG 43 updates include: 1) eliminating apparent activity for specification of source strength, 2) eliminating the anisotropy constant in favor of the distance dependent 1-D anisotropy function, $\phi_an(r)$, and 3) providing guidance on extrapolating tabulated TG-43 parameters to longer and shorter distance.  
 
The air kerma strength and apparent activity conversion is 1 U = 0.348, 0.243, 0.486, 0.787, and 0.773 mCi for Cs-137, Ir-192, Au-198, I-125, and Pd-103, respectively. 

## Traceability

Calibrations of brachytherapy sources should be directly traced to NIST or to an Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory (ADCL) which is traced to NIST. Normally, we don't send sources to NIST or ADCL, but instead a well chamber with specific inserts designed for different isotopes. To calibrate [Bard\ PS-1251L](http://www.bardmedical.com/products/prostate-health/brachytherapy/source-and-delivery-systems/iodine-125/) I-125 sources, for instance, the well chamber with an I-125 insert will be used, which was checked using Bard PS-1251L I-125 sources at NIST or ADLC.   

TG-40

- all long half-life sources should be calibrated; 
- at least 10% or 2 ribbons (whichever is larger) should be calibrated for a large number of loose seeds with **short** half-life. 

If the institution's verification of source strength disagrees with the manufacturer's data by more than 3%, the source of the disagreement should be investigated. We further recommend that an unresolved disparity exceeding 5% should be reported to the manufacturer.

Radioactive materials must be under control by the facility at all times. This means under direct control or by securing in a locked area.
