<font color="Salmon">image registration</font> — the process of determining the geometric **transformation** that relates identical (anatomic) points in two image series: a moving dataset (Study A) and a stationary source dataset (Study B).[^itk]

[^itk]:
[ITK](https://itk.org/Doxygen47/html/RegistrationPage.html): a technique aimed to align two images using a particular transformation.

<font color="Salmon">image fusion</font> — the combined display of the mapped data from the moving dataset with the stationary dataset.

### Techniques for image registration

Image registration algorithms require four components: a geometric transformation T, a registration metric R, an optimizer which drives the algorithm to find the best result of the registration metrics and finally image resampling and application of the transformation.

```
The registration is defined by 9 criteria: dimensionality (2D or 3D), nature of registration basis, nature of transformation, domain of transformation, interaction, optimization procedure, modalities involved, subject, object.

*gemometry-based metrics*

The most common geometry‐based registration metrics involve the use of <font color="Salmon">point matching</font> or <font color="Salmon">surface matching</font>. 

\begin{equation}
R = \sum(P_{A'}-P_B)^2/N
\end{equation}

*Inensity-based metrics*

In different modalities, the pixel intensities of corresponding anatomy are typically different. Thus registration metrics based on simple differences or products of intensities are not effective. In these cases, sophisticated metrics based on intensity statistics are more appropriate. One of these metrics is called <font color="Salmon">mutual information</font> (MI):

\begin{equation}
MI(I_{A'},I_B) = \sum_B\sum_A P(I_{A'},I_B) log_2[p(I_{A'},I_B)/p(I_{A'}),p(I_B)]
(\#eq:mi)
\end{equation}

where p(IA’) and p(IB) are the probability distribution functions of the intensities I~{A’}~ and I~B~, respectively and p(IA’, IB) is the joint probability distribution function. Essentially, mutual information seeks to align voxels whose values have **common probabilities** of being present in their respective image sets.


### QA for image registration

Historically, the image registration is mostly used for manual or semiautomatically segmentation. Currently, image registration has been used for adaptive treatment planning, IGRT, and response assessment. 

According to TG-132, the QA program should include:

- Validation and QA of image registration and fusion at treatment planning, treatment delivery, adaptive re‐planning, and response assessment
- Commissioning image registration and fusion software to ensure accuracy of the tools used
- Define/assign the role of each team member and tailor workflow and tolerances appropriately depending on the intended use of the image registration
- Clinical verification of image registration for individual patients.

DVH See Chapter 11 Q6 

## Differential DVH 

The choice of c): a certain dose within a specified dose interval as a function of dose. The differential DVH is similar to conventional histogram in statistics.
