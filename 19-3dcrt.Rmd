## Image registration

* Brady: Geometric (and Photometric) alignment of one image with another – Images may be of same or different types (MR, CT, and etc.) 
* ITK: The process of determining the spatial transformation that maps points from one image to homologous points on an object in the second image.
* Elastix: The task of finding a spatial one-to-one mapping from voxels in one image to voxels in the other image.

## Image segmentation 

http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/ibv/reader/chapter10.pdf: the division of an image into meaning structures.
Wiki: image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels)  Khan: slice-by-slice delineation of targets and organs-at-risk

## Cumulative DVH

DVH See Chapter 11 Q6 

## Differential DVH 

The choice of c): a certain dose within a specified dose interval as a function of dose. The differential DVH is similar to conventional histogram in statistics.
