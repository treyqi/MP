# Introduction {#introduction}

## Physics constants {#constant}

The constants are available from the [NIST website](http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/) supported by National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST). 

The important __constants__ used in medical physics are:

* Avogadro constant: $N_A = 6.022\times10^{23}$ mol^^-1^^
* Speed of light in vacuum: $c = 2.998\times10^8$ m/s
* Atomic mass constant: $u = 1.661\times10^{−27}$ kg = $931.5$ MeV/c^^2^^
* Elementary charge: $e = 1.602\times10^{−19}$ C`
* Electron rest mass: $m_e = 9.109\times10^{−31}$ kg = $0.5110$ MeV/c^^2^^
* Proton rest mass: $m_p = 1.673\times10^{−27}$ kg = $1.007$ u = $938.3$ MeV/c^^2^^
* Neutron rest mass: $m_n = 1.675\times10^{−27}$ kg = $1.009$ u = $939.6$ MeV/c^^2^^
* Planck constant: $h = 6.626×10^{−34}$ J$\cdot$s = $4.136\times10^{−15}$ eV$\cdot$s

The SI system of units

The __7 base quantities__ and their units are

* Length: meter (m)
* Mass: kilogram (kg)
* Time: second (s)
* Electric current: ampere (A)
* Temperature: kelvin (K)
* Amount of substance: mole (mol)
* Luminous intensity: candela (cd)

## Atomic Representation {#atomic-rep}

Atoms = Nucleus (neutron and protons)[^rutherford] + Orbital electrons[^bohr]

$$^A_ZX$$

* A ($\color{Green}{\text{mass\ number}}$) - the number of protons and neutrons
* Z ($\color{Green}{\text{atomic\ number}}$) - the number of proton number
* X ($\color{Green}{\text{chemical\ element}}$) - for the element

Atomcs can be classified in terms of the number of protons, neutrons, mass, and (meta)state.

* Isoto**p**e
* Isoto**n**e
* Isob**a**r
* Iso**m**er (same A, Z, N but different energy *meta*-states; eg $_{43}^{99m}Tc$ is in metastable[^metastable] state and $^{99}_{43}Tc$ is in stable state)

## Stability

The stability depends on the ratio of neutron and proton (see Figure \@ref(fig:halflife))

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, halflife, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap="Stability of isotopes"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/isotope_halflife.png")
```

## Mass Defect

The mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the sum of the individual masses of the free constituent protons and neutrons. This “missing mass” is known as the $\color{Green}{\text{mass\ defect}}$. For example, the mass defect of a ^12^C atom can be calculated by:
$$ 6 \times m_p + 6 \times m_n + 6 \times m_e - m_{C} = 0.0988\ amu$$
where $m_C = 12$ (the ratio of mass to 1 amu). The complete list of mass number can be found in the [NIST database](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl). 

The mass defect is closed related to $\color{Green}{\text{nuclear binding energy}}$. If we divide the above energy by 12 and times 931.5 MeV/amu, we obtain the bind energy per neucleio for ^12^C is 7.67 (see Figure \@ref(fig:stability)) 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, stability, fig.align='center', out.width='80%',fig.cap= 'Nuclear binding energy per nucleon (The image is from wiki)'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/binding_energy.png")
```

A complete table of nuclear bind energies can be found on Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [(link)](http://xdb.lbl.gov/Section1/Table_1-1.pdf).

## High energy charged particles {#einstein}

The mass of a moving particle (not a photon) depends on its velocity $\upsilon$ and its rest mass $m_0$.

\begin{equation}
    E_{total} = mc^2 = \frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\upsilon^2}{c^2}}} 
    (\#eq:emc2)
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
    E_{total} = E_{rest}+E_{K.E} 
\end{equation}

For an electron and a proton accelerated to the velocity of 0.96 c, the kinetic energy will be about 2 MeV and 2400 MeV. Therefore, high energy electrons coming out of linac head will have the speed close to the speed of light. To achieve similar high speed, you need give much more energy to a proton than an electron. 

## High energy photons

The energy of a photon is given by

\begin{equation}
    E = h\cdot v
    (\#eq:frequency)
\end{equation}
where h is the Planck constant ([Physical constants](#constant)), $v$ is the frequency in unit of s^{-1}^.

Or
\begin{equation}
    E (eV) = \frac{1.24\times 10^{6}}{\lambda (m)}, 
    (\#eq:wavelength)
\end{equation}


## Electron Shell

* <span style="color:green"> Principle </span> quantum number ($n = 1, 2, 3, ...$ or K, L, M, ...)  – the main energy level (or shell) occupied by an electron. The energy can be calculated by$$E_n=\frac{Z^2{\hbar}^2}{2m_0\alpha^2_Bn^2},$$ where $\alpha_B$ is the $\color{Green}{\text{bohr radius}}$ ($5.29 \times 10^{-11}m$). The __K shell__ (binding) energy for Lead, Tungsten, and Carbon are 88, 69.5, and 0.28 KeV. 
* <span style="color:green"> Secondary </span> quantum number ($l = s, p, d, ...$)  – the energy sublevel (angular monentum) occupied by the electron.
* <span style="color:green"> Magnetic </span> quantum number ($m_l = -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l$) – the number of possible orientations (projections) for each of energy sublevels.
* <span style="color:green"> Spin </span> quantum number ($m_s=-1/2, 1/2$) – the two possible orientations that an electron can have in the presence of a magnetic field.

[^metastable]:
$\color{Green}{\text{Metastabe}}$ state is an excited state of an atom that has a longer lifetime than the ordinary excited states but generally has a shorter lifetime than the lowest, often stable, energy state, called the ground state. [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/metastable-state) 

[^rutherford]:
Rutherford interpreted the results of the [gold foil experiment or Geiger-Marsden experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment) and established the Rutherford model of atom, which constitutes a tiny ($10^{-15}$ m), heavy nucleus which consists of protons and/or neutrons. He also won [the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/) “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances”. He discovered three types of radiation: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and later $\gamma$ radiation. 

[^bohr]:
In 1913, Bohr proposed a theory for the hydrogen atom based on __quantum theory__ that (a) electrons orbit around the nucleus; (b) electrons orbits at a certain discrete set of distances from the nucleus without radiation and energy loss; (c) electrons can only gain and lose energy by jumping from one allowed orbit to another, absorbing or emitting electromagnetic radiation with a frequency: $v=\frac{E_m-E_n}{h}$. He won [the Nobel Prize in Physics 1922](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/).

[^amu]:
atomic mass unit; 1/12 mass of $_6^{12}\textrm{C}$ atom in quantity; $1amu = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} kg$ or **931.5** MeV.
